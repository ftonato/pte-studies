## Story

First, let’s clarify the difference between **_“number”_** and **_“amount”_** – we use **_“number”_** with countable nouns, and **_“amount”_** with uncountable nouns.

- A **large number** of people
- A **massive amount** of damage
- A **significant number** of countries
- A **considerable amount** of money
- A **tiny number** of computers
- A **miniscule amount** of alcohol

Numbers and statistics can **_increase_** or **_decrease_** _(more formal)_, **_rise_** or **_fall_** _(also formal)_ or **_go up_** and **_go down_** _(more informally)_. When a number goes up or down very fast, we can describe this as **sharp or dramatic** – for example, the sudden improvement in the economy has resulted in a **dramatic drop** in unemployment and a **sharp rise** in consumer spending. When a number goes up or down slowly, then we can talk about a **gradual increase** in population or a **slow decline** in the number of violent crimes. And if a number doesn’t change, then it **remains steady** or **remains constant.**

We use the word **_“widespread”_** to describe something that is happening frequently in many places. For example, there being **widespread dissatisfaction** with the government, or a new book winning **widespread acclaim** in the literary world. A hurricane can cause **widespread damage,** and a presidential candidate can have **widespread support** among voters of a certain demographic.

In conversational English, we often use the structure **_keep + -ING_** to describe something that happens frequently. For example,

- _“I’m trying to work, but my colleagues **keep interrupting** me._”
- _“Why do you **keep asking** me about the problem? I’ve told you a thousand times I don’t know how to solve it.”_

## Quiz

_Choose the best word to complete this opinion letter in a magazine:_

The **heavy / sharp** rise in obesity is a major cause for concern. A **significant / steady** percentage of adults are now overweight, and the **amount / number** of children with weight problems is also **getting up / going up.** This crisis is partly due to the **overall / widespread** consumption of processed foods with high **amounts / numbers** of fat and sugar. We’re exposed to an excessive **amount / number** of advertisements that **keep / stay** encouraging us to consume more and more food with less and less nutritional value.

Other contributing factors to the obesity epidemic include a **gradual / low** increase in portion sizes and a **drop / lack** in the average **amount / number** of physical exercise practiced by the population. A **short / miniscule** number of kids nowadays play sports; instead, they prefer to spend a **considerable / conventional** amount of time in front of computers, TVs, and video games.

Health problems caused by excess weight have resulted in a **dramatic / vivid** increase in health care costs, and although the life expectancy has remained **reliable / steady** over the past 30 years, we can expect to see a **decay / decline** if the trend of over-eating and under-exercising continues.
