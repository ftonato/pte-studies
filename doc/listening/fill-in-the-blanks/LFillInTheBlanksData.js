    transcript: `For four centuries after the Viking <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>declined</span>, the people of the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland continued to sell their goods through the North European Hanseatic League. The Hansa merchant bought shiploads of <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>salted</span> fish and in return the islanders got cash, grain, cloth and other goods. This lasted until the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. This Act prohibited the Hansa merchant from <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>trading</span> with Scotland. Consequently Shetland went into an economic <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>depression</span>. The independent farmers of Shetland had to sell their land and were then <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>obligated</span> to pay rent, eventually becoming serfs.`,

    transcript: `Well, the simple explanation might be that yesterday's <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>sudden</span> drop in share prices pretty much across the board has created what market analysts like to call a buying opportunity. It tends to bring out investors to pick through the ruins, looking for <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>bargains</span>. What seems to be happening today is this decision by investors that sellers got a little carried away with things so the buyers have <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>lifted</span> all the major indexes today. The Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 were all up around half a percent in early trading today, and that wasn't a big surprise. The sell-off continued somewhat <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>overseas</span>, but you could watch things stabilize abroad. European markets remain fairly weak, along with many of the Asian markets. But you'll remember that all this started with a big <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>plunge</span> of around 9 percent on the stock market in Shanghai. Well, Chinese stocks rebounded by around 4 percent, and that kind of set the tone.`,

    transcript: `Fungi are an important part of any forest or woodland <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>ecosystem</span>. They are the major agents by which twigs and leaves are broken down, releasing <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>nutrients</span> for reabsorption by plants. And we know fungi also form a <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>constructive</span> partnership with living trees.

You have to go right back into the last Ice Age, so the sort of temperature difference we're talking about in the future, of course going up, is <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>similar</span> to the temperature difference between a warm period and a typical Ice Age. So what this means is that the world's climate system will change <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>radically</span>. If you just take one country, India; India is totally dependent on the monsoon. If the monsoon fails one year - that means, the word <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>failure</span> implies less than 10% of average rainfall, then they have <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>massive</span> crop failure.

    transcript: `One of the things that people have said about agriculture is that on the whole it is more labor-<input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>intensive</span> than hunting and gathering, and that’s one of the reasons why people have looked to explanations which, you might say, are kind of <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>coercive</span> factors – that people have been forced into agriculture because they had no alternative. That is <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>ultimately</span> what may happen. But at the very beginning it could be that agriculture was developed because people wanted special status foods for feasting; that it was actually a <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>social</span> need. I mean, how much of what we do in our lives is generated by competition with others?

Respect and recognition also are important. And in small-scale societies a lot of those sorts of factors are <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank5"> <span class='answer hidden'>generated</span> by the ability to, for instance, throw feasts.

Well the same thing when the Delta was built by the Mississippi, the Delta itself compacts over time, and under a <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>natural</span> hydrology the river would bring sediments back out to those areas and deposit sediments on top of areas that are <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>subsiding</span>, and so we actually build land with an active delta.`,

    transcript: `Scientists filming in one of the world's deepest ocean trenches, have found groups of highly <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>sociable</span> snail fish swarming out of their bait nearly five miles beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean. This is the first-time cameras have been sent to this <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>depth</span>. Although some species of snail fish live in the <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>shallow</span> water, the hadal snail fish are found exclusively below 6000 meters. Here they have to contend with total <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>darkness</span> near freezing temperatures and immense water pressure, equivalent to 1,600 elephants standing on the roof of a mini car. They feed on thousands of tiny shrimp-like creatures that scavenged the carcasses of dead fish reaching the ocean <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>floor</span>.`,
