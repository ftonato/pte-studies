    transcript: `For four centuries after the Viking <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>declined</span>, the people of the Shetland Islands off the north coast of Scotland continued to sell their goods through the North European Hanseatic League. The Hansa merchant bought shiploads of <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>salted</span> fish and in return the islanders got cash, grain, cloth and other goods. This lasted until the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707. This Act prohibited the Hansa merchant from <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>trading</span> with Scotland. Consequently Shetland went into an economic <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>depression</span>. The independent farmers of Shetland had to sell their land and were then <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>obligated</span> to pay rent, eventually becoming serfs.`,

    transcript: `Well, the simple explanation might be that yesterday's <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank0"> <span class='answer hidden'>sudden</span> drop in share prices pretty much across the board has created what market analysts like to call a buying opportunity. It tends to bring out investors to pick through the ruins, looking for <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>bargains</span>. What seems to be happening today is this decision by investors that sellers got a little carried away with things so the buyers have <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>lifted</span> all the major indexes today. The Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 were all up around half a percent in early trading today, and that wasn't a big surprise. The sell-off continued somewhat <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>overseas</span>, but you could watch things stabilize abroad. European markets remain fairly weak, along with many of the Asian markets. But you'll remember that all this started with a big <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>plunge</span> of around 9 percent on the stock market in Shanghai. Well, Chinese stocks rebounded by around 4 percent, and that kind of set the tone.`,

When <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>exposed</span> to UV light, the chemical changes its structure and become soluble in water. This causes two layers to form with the oil floating on top of the water chemical combo. This method should be cheaper than the current alternative which involves using high energy centrifuges.`,
