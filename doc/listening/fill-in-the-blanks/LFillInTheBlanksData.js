It tends to bring out investors to pick through the ruins, looking for <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>bargains</span>. What seems to be happening today is this decision by investors that sellers got a little carried away with things so the buyers have <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>lifted</span> all the major indexes today. The Dow, the NASDAQ, the S&amp;P 500 were all up around half a percent in early trading today, and that wasn't a big surprise. The sell-off continued somewhat <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>overseas</span>, but you could watch things stabilize abroad. European markets remain fairly weak, along with many of the Asian markets. But you'll remember that all this started with a big <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank4"> <span class='answer hidden'>plunge</span> of around 9 percent on the stock market in Shanghai. Well, Chinese stocks rebounded by around 4 percent, and that kind of set the tone.`,

So what this means is that the world's climate system will change <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>radically</span>. If you just take one country, India; India is totally dependent on the monsoon.

That is <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>ultimately</span> what may happen.

On the other hand, if you’re going to increase in numbers, and we increased from five pairs then to 2,000 pairs in 1972 when I started up to about 80,000 pairs in 2003, you’ve got to have a lot of food. I mean you’ve got to have a hell of a lot of fish however small a bird that you are. And there seems to be <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank1"> <span class='answer hidden'>profound</span> changes in the North Sea where man removed all the large fish – the large cod, the haddock and those sorts of things – for human consumption. And the numbers of small fish increased and this <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>allowed</span>the seabirds to increase. You’ve got a lot of big fish that are of no use to seabirds, they’re just too big. I mean puffins will only eat fish up to about 20 centimetres long. Anything bigger than that is <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank3"> <span class='answer hidden'>safe</span> from a puffin.`,

Essentially, if you receive a dozen messages from desirable users, you must be more desirable than someone who receives the same number of messages from average users.

"I think people are optimistic <input autocomplete="off" type="text" class="blank" id="blank2"> <span class='answer hidden'>realists</span>." In other words, they found that both men and women tended to pursue mates just 25 percent more desirable than themselves.
