    topic: "Human rights",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">The human right acts</span> can be seen as far reaching as <span class="text-highlight">controversial in the UK history of rights</span>, at the same times it can be described as some more <span class="text-highlight">cautious document</span> that provide <span class="text-highlight">a starting point for wider application for law to rights</span>. In many ways the <span class="text-highlight">freedom protection</span> contains <span class="text-highlight">within the human rights act</span> were <span class="text-highlight">not new to people living in the UK</span>. The act presents to the UK law, most of the clauses the European conventional human rights. The convention itself was divides following the end of the Second World War by the council of beau. UK lawyers played <span class="text-highlight">a significant role in the drafting of the convention</span> and the UK was among the first governments to rectify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature but to say some can be express as a right too and others are a freedom from. The 1988 act puts into place 15 specific crimes in freedoms which includes rights to limited security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry into family to family. There are also <span class="text-highlight">freedoms from torture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">from slavery</span> or <span class="text-highlight">force labour</span> and <span class="text-highlight">from discrimination</span> grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The human right acts has been described as <span class="text-highlight">the start of a process</span>, the act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European convention, which some of consider as holding <span class="text-highlight">a baseline or a minimum standard of the human rights</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the history of human rights, which can be described as a starting point for wider application in the UK. He also indicated that the freedom protection within the Human Right Act included freedoms from torture, from slavery and from discrimination. He emphasized that UK lawyers played a significant role in the drafting of the convention and the UK was the first governments to rectify it. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "London Architecture",
    transcript: `It seems to me that <span class="text-highlight">architecture</span> is very much something that <span class="text-highlight">causes it both pleasure and trouble</span>. I'm from a part of West London, where I feel that many of the streets where I live really, really ugly. And this distresses me every time I walk into a supermarket or walk to the tube and think, god why did they build that? And <span class="text-highlight">terrible problem with architecture</span> is that it <span class="text-highlight">last so long</span>, if you write a bad book or do a bad play, you know it’ll have a short run and then be shelved and no one will suffer, a <span class="text-highlight">bad building</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">serious impact</span> for, could be hundreds of years, <span class="text-highlight">on the people around it</span> and um especially the book a rose a little bit of frustration was anger. There was so many bad architecture around and then I realized when you talk to architectures and you say um why building not more beautiful, they’ll say ‘Ma, how you use such a word as beauty, that’s a really arrogant word. No one knows what beautiful, it’s all <span class="text-highlight">in the eyes of the beholder</span>.’ I couldn’t help but think that actually, well you know, we all tend to agree that in Rome is nicer than Milton Keynes and that San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt Tyfull. You may ask for generalization, surely there are something’s we can say about <span class="text-highlight">why a building works and why it doesn’t</span>. So, the book is already in an attempted to suggest <span class="text-highlight">why architectures works</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it does</span> and <span class="text-highlight">what might be going wrong</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it doesn’t work</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the concept of architecture that causes both pleasure and trouble. He firstly indicated that a poorly designed building has serious impacts on the people around it. He strongly agreed that there was so much bad architecture and emphasized terrible problems with architecture as it lasts longer than a bad book or a bad play. He finally introduced a book to suggest why and how architecture works. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Big Bang",
    transcript: `One of the <span class="text-highlight">most amazing things that’s happened</span> even in my lifetime is the <span class="text-highlight">prediction of cosmology</span>. When I started out forty odd years ago, we thought we knew that <span class="text-highlight">the universe began a big bang</span> , some people doubted even then. We thought <span class="text-highlight">the universe</span> was about ten or twenty billion years old but now for really very sound <span class="text-highlight">scientific reasons</span> we can say that the universe did started in a Big bang and it’s 13.8 billion years old so it’s not 14, its not 13 because <span class="text-highlight">a decimal point in there</span> and that’s a <span class="text-highlight">stunning achievement</span> to know that. And we also know that the <span class="text-highlight">laws of physical</span> that apply to <span class="text-highlight">tiny particles inside atoms</span> also <span class="text-highlight">explains what happened in the big bang</span> you can’t have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply <span class="text-highlight">nuclear physics</span>, that kind of physics to understand <span class="text-highlight">how stars work</span>, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So their universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic, if we done it and counted in the other way around and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say <span class="text-highlight">science</span> were in deep trouble. But it’s not, everything fits together and we know <span class="text-highlight">how the universe began</span>, we got to know how the way it is. The future that it ‘ll suspects we don’t know quiet well what’s going, but we got some ideas, which are as good as those ideas we had 40 years ago about <span class="text-highlight">how big bang happened</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the prediction of cosmology which is one of the most amazing things that happened in his lifetime. He firstly had a discussion about a stunning achievement to know that the Universe did start in a Big Bang and it is 13.8 billion years old. In addition, he emphasized the laws of physics explaining what happened in the Big Bang helped scientists know exactly how the universe began. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Danger of keeping drugs at home",
    transcript: `“But what are the <span class="text-highlight">dangers of keeping these drugs</span> at home?”<br/><br/>
    “There are a number of dangers. Parents should know that <span class="text-highlight">leftover drugs are dangerous</span> because they may be <span class="text-highlight">accidentally ingested by children</span>. Either adults don’t keep the bottles properly closed and stored or because even many kids can sometimes open childproof lids. <span class="text-highlight">Patients may use the drugs after their expiration date</span>. The leftover drugs may be <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong reasons</span>. For example, someone may have a <span class="text-highlight">viral infection</span> and <span class="text-highlight">self-prescribed</span> to left over into microbial that was prescribed for a bacterial infection. But that drug will have no effect as the viral infections. Drugs that are left over might be given to or taken by someone else who may have a <span class="text-highlight">serious allergy</span> to the medicine and who for that reason would not be prescribed to medicine under the supervision of a physician. Finally, <span class="text-highlight">inappropriate use of drugs promotes drug resistance</span> if the drug is <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong indication, the wrong duration, or in the wrong dosage</span>.<br/><br/>
    “Todd, what can people do about this how can the situation be improved?”<br/><br/>
    “I think <span class="text-highlight">physicians, patients and parents of patients</span> can take steps to <span class="text-highlight">improve the situation</span>. First of all, physicians should <span class="text-highlight">prescribe the drug only when appropriate</span>, only in the <span class="text-highlight">correct amount</span> and only for the <span class="text-highlight">correct duration</span>. Also, the physician must <span class="text-highlight">stress to the patient</span> that the <span class="text-highlight">full course of the drug must be taken</span>. This is recommended <span class="text-highlight">even if symptoms resolved before the end of the prescription</span> and parents of children on antibiotics need to ensure they complete their course as well.”`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the dangers of keeping drugs. He indicated that leftover drugs are dangerous because they may be accidentally taken by children. In addition, patients may use their drugs after their expiration date and the leftover drugs may be taken for the wrong decision. Finally, he strongly recommended that both patients and their parents can take important steps to improve the situation of the inappropriate use of drugs. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Talent war version 2",
    transcript: `The time in late ninety-nineties when <span class="text-highlight">management consultants</span> wrote books with titles such as ‘<span class="text-highlight">The war for talent</span>’, there was a great deal of talk about the <span class="text-highlight">talent wars</span>. Then I think there was the <span class="text-highlight">bursting of the bubble</span> with the bursting of the dark karma book and a sense of the people who had been <span class="text-highlight">masters of the universe</span> just a few weeks before were out on the streets looking for jobs. I think this created a <span class="text-highlight">reaction</span>, it gave me ideas of that <span class="text-highlight">there was a war for talent</span>, in fact all of the things were saw in late ninety-nineties are <span class="text-highlight">reasserting</span> themselves now, all those shortages are reasserting themselves and the real reason the audit was really the bursting of the bubble not the <span class="text-highlight">shortages of talent</span>. There are very <span class="text-highlight">profound structural forces</span>, which are created these talent shortages. One is the fact that <span class="text-highlight">the</span>nature of the economy<span class="text-highlight">is changing</span>; it’s putting more and <span class="text-highlight">more premium upon intellectual skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">analytical skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">creative skills</span>, which <span class="text-highlight">are in short supply</span> so there is a demand increase but there is also a <span class="text-highlight">decrease incline</span>. Because we’re seeing now the <span class="text-highlight">age of baby pool</span> the <span class="text-highlight">shirking of population</span> in Europe, Japan and not very long in China as well and the sort of stabilization that the population of the United States. So we see a time when there is a greater demand for <span class="text-highlight">intellectual skills</span> and slowing down in the supple of people who possess those skills and also a <span class="text-highlight">mismatch between the sort of things that people are learning at school</span>, when university and the sort of things the economy is placing a premium on, particularly with the <span class="text-highlight">shortage of trained people in the sciences and engineering</span> so for all sort of reasons there’s a <span class="text-highlight">premium on talent</span>.`,

The other purpose of Stanford University is to promote learning; <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of school education is to promote learning about education</span>, <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of the business school is to promote learning about management</span>. Most of the world’s businesses services are delivered by <span class="text-highlight">managed instincts institutions</span>, that are <span class="text-highlight">for-profit managed institutions, not-for-profit managed institutions</span>. We rely on the managed institutions that’s our <span class="text-highlight">chosen instrument society</span> to get things done and implement services, particularly educational services which is done by people on their own. The quality of which is done, the performance that underlies how that ever takes place is perfect and we think that in a school of business, the school management has a lot to do with management. The people who <span class="text-highlight">take responsibility</span> for the results, a tremendous sense of worship were saying that they get accomplished and that the work that must be done through other people is in fact done and that there is a capability also by the mangers and people that they feel responsible for.`,

    topic: "Australian Housing",
    transcript: `Well it's like, <span class="text-highlight">why is Australian housing so expensive</span>? Essentially it's a showing of <span class="text-highlight">how well the Australian economy has been doing over the last 15 years</span>. We have had 15 years, more or less of uninterrupted and economic growth during which <span class="text-highlight">average earnings</span> have risen by close to &nbsp;90%. While over the course of that period the <span class="text-highlight">standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved</span>. That meant that the amount which a typical home buying household can afford to borrow under rules which aren’t strictly applied as which they used to be, have more than doubled. Over the same period <span class="text-highlight">rising immigration</span> and <span class="text-highlight">falling average household size</span> have meant that the <span class="text-highlight">number households looking for accommodation has risen</span> by about <span class="text-highlight">one and a half million</span>, that's around 200 thousand more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So you have had a <span class="text-highlight">substantial increase</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">purchasing power of households</span>, no net increase in the supply of housing and hence all that addition purchasing power has gone into <span class="text-highlight">pushing up the price of housing</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the main reason why Australian housing is expensive. She firstly introduced many concepts including economic growth, average earnings, mortgage rate, immigration issues, and home buying households who afford to borrow money. Additionally, she explained that the number of households looking for accommodations has significantly increased over the period of time. Finally, she concluded that purchasing power is the main factor pushing up the price of housing.  _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Language Death",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Language death is not a mainstream theatre</span>. It is not mainstream anything. Can you imagine Hollywood taking it on? It is so far <span class="text-highlight">outside the mindsets of most people</span> that they have a difficulty appreciating what the crisis is all about because they are not used to thinking more about language as an issue in itself. Somehow, we need to change these mindsets. We need to <span class="text-highlight">get people thinking more about language more explicitly</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more intimately</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more enthusiastically</span>. Interest in language is certainly there, in the general population. Most people <span class="text-highlight">are fascinated by such topics</span> as <span class="text-highlight">where words come from</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">what the origin of their town’s name is</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">whether their baby’s name means anything</span>; they are certainly prepared to play Scrabble and a host of other language games and infinitum; and you get language games on radio and television too – but a <span class="text-highlight">willingness</span> to focus that interest on general issues, a <span class="text-highlight">preparedness to take on board the emotion</span> and <span class="text-highlight">drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment</span>, <span class="text-highlight">is not something that happens much</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about language death which is not a mainstream theatre. In addition, he emphasized the importance of changing humans’ mindsets about languages. He suggested that people should think about language more explicitly, more intimately and more enthusiastically. Although people are interested in many language topics, they lack a willingness to focus and a preparedness to take on board the drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "Universe (or Einstein)",
    transcript: `For thousands of years, <span class="text-highlight">philosophers and astronomers</span> think of all sorts and imagine of <span class="text-highlight">the universe</span>, <span class="text-highlight">this space around us</span>. It's <span class="text-highlight">rather like a constant</span>. It was <span class="text-highlight">fixed and unchangeable</span>, and things happened in it. Just as <span class="text-highlight">people walk around</span>, so <span class="text-highlight">stars</span>, the <span class="text-highlight">comets</span>, the planets, and the other heavenly bodies<span class="text-highlight">moved around and trace down their parts on this completely</span>unchanging status space<span class="text-highlight">. In the 21st century, as</span>the result of Einstein's work<span class="text-highlight">that</span>fixed and unchangeable<span class="text-highlight">universe</span>was completely transformer<span class="text-highlight">. We began to understand that the universe is</span>absolutely not fixed<span class="text-highlight">state stage of space at all on which also listed emotions played out.

And the real <span class="text-highlight">important</span> word there is if because it turns out that  in  <span class="text-highlight">climates</span> which aren't  <span class="text-highlight">near</span> the <span class="text-highlight">equator</span>, there’s a <span class="text-highlight">big</span>   <span class="text-highlight">question</span> as to whether human beings get  <span class="text-highlight">enough</span>  sunshine. That's important because <span class="text-highlight">fruits</span> are not<span class="text-highlight">naturally</span> <span class="text-highlight">abundant</span> in <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span>, and that's why <span class="text-highlight">milk</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">fortified</span>. But the <span class="text-highlight">fortification</span> may not be <span class="text-highlight">enough</span>. So again, if  <span class="text-highlight">exposure</span> to  <span class="text-highlight">sunlight</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">adequate</span> ,  <span class="text-highlight">no need</span> for  <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span> . So vitamin D really isn't a vitamin, it's a  <span class="text-highlight">pro-hormone</span> . When <span class="text-highlight">human beings</span> <span class="text-highlight">evolve</span>, we evolve in <span class="text-highlight">tropical climates</span> and run around naked, there was plenty of <span class="text-highlight">skin exposure</span>  to  <span class="text-highlight">sunlight</span>, and so there was  <span class="text-highlight">no dietary need</span>  for vitamin D. As humans <span class="text-highlight">migrated</span>  away from <span class="text-highlight">equatorial regions</span>, they actually created a <span class="text-highlight">need</span> for <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span>  in  <span class="text-highlight">food</span> because sunlight was <span class="text-highlight">inadequate</span>, particularly during the <span class="text-highlight">winter</span> and especially if you have to  <span class="text-highlight">wear clothes</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about vitamin D, which is called the sunshine vitamin. Vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a pro-hormone which is necessary in food for people who do not get adequate sunshine. In addition, people migrating away from equatorial regions need this type of vitamin. However, foods are not always naturally abundant in vitamin D and people do not need it if their exposure to sunlight is adequate. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Analysing Questionnaires",
    transcript: `Questions can be divided into <span class="text-highlight">three types</span>. This is sometimes called level of <span class="text-highlight">measurement</span>. Firstly, we have <span class="text-highlight">category</span>  <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span>, which are also known as <span class="text-highlight">nominal</span> <span class="text-highlight">questions</span>. These are when <span class="text-highlight">participants</span>  <span class="text-highlight">select</span>  from a list of <span class="text-highlight">categories</span> for their  <span class="text-highlight">response</span> , such as <span class="text-highlight">male</span> or <span class="text-highlight">female</span>, or they may include <span class="text-highlight">ethnic origin</span>. Secondly, we have <span class="text-highlight">ordinal</span>  <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span>. These are <span class="text-highlight">similar</span> to category questions. But instead of the categories being <span class="text-highlight">independent</span>, there is some sort of <span class="text-highlight">order</span> between them. If we ask people to  <span class="text-highlight">indicate</span>  their  <span class="text-highlight">age</span> in categories, this is an  <span class="text-highlight">ordinal</span>   <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span> . Thirdly, we have <span class="text-highlight">continuous</span>  <span class="text-highlight">questions</span>. These are any question that can be  <span class="text-highlight">answered</span>  by a  <span class="text-highlight">number</span> . It could be an <span class="text-highlight">open-ended</span>   <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, asking participants to tell you how many  <span class="text-highlight">times</span>  they  <span class="text-highlight">attended lectures</span> , or how often they  <span class="text-highlight">use</span>  the  <span class="text-highlight">valley</span> .Or it could involve asking them to write the <span class="text-highlight">importance</span> or <span class="text-highlight">intensity</span> of some <span class="text-highlight">experience</span>. The reasons are to remind you the type of questions is our <span class="text-highlight">choice</span> of <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, this type of tough <span class="text-highlight">analysis</span> we can use. Therefore, it’s <span class="text-highlight">important</span> to get our <span class="text-highlight">questionnaires</span>  <span class="text-highlight">correct</span> in the first place.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about three main types of questionnaires and introduced some terms to use when analysing responses. He firstly mentioned the category type questions, which are called nominal questions.

    topic: "Why Read Plato’s book? (The Republic)",
    transcript: `Why should we <span class="text-highlight">read</span> the <span class="text-highlight">Republic</span>? There might be lots of students asked this question to themselves given a set book at the beginning of their university course. But in fact there are many good  <span class="text-highlight">reasons</span> to read the Republic and the first one I would pick on is just that it is  <span class="text-highlight">immensely</span>  <span class="text-highlight">readable</span>. It's not <span class="text-highlight">Plato</span>  did not write <span class="text-highlight">philosophy</span> like a <span class="text-highlight">dry text book</span>. He wrote it like a <span class="text-highlight">living conversation.</span> The whole of the Republic, which is a fairly fat  <span class="text-highlight">book</span>  is a living conversation written in short almost sound bite  <span class="text-highlight">type answers</span> , but nevertheless <span class="text-highlight">developing</span> some very, very <span class="text-highlight">important ideas</span>. So my first answer, then we should read the republic just because it is readable. It was <span class="text-highlight">written</span> by a <span class="text-highlight">genius</span> and it's <span class="text-highlight">worth reading</span>. It's <span class="text-highlight">easy</span> to <span class="text-highlight">read</span>, it's <span class="text-highlight">not difficult.</span> But then there's also obviously the the thoughts, the  <span class="text-highlight">content</span> of the book, and he's asking this absolutely <span class="text-highlight">fundamental question</span>, why should we bother to be good? What's in it for us effectively? It seems when we look at the world that looks as though injustice pays, it looks as though crime pays, or as the good people get trodden down, so Plato <span class="text-highlight">addresses</span> this absolutely <span class="text-highlight">fundamental question</span>. Why should we be good? I'm not going to tell you his answer, read the book. And then there's, he gives. It's a <span class="text-highlight">thought-provoking book</span>. So first of all, what I'm trying to say is it's <span class="text-highlight">accessible</span> to anybody to read, and it will provoke people to think. He asks the question, <span class="text-highlight">what is</span><span class="text-highlight">justice</span>? He gives an <span class="text-highlight">astonishing answer</span>  and answer this bound to make anybody think because it doesn't frame the answer in terms that we would expect, like  <span class="text-highlight">justice</span>  is to do with <span class="text-highlight">equity</span> or how you <span class="text-highlight">deal with</span> other <span class="text-highlight">people</span>, your  <span class="text-highlight">friends</span> your  <span class="text-highlight">family</span> , the  <span class="text-highlight">world</span>   <span class="text-highlight">around you</span> . He frames an answer in terms of how you should <span class="text-highlight">structure</span> the <span class="text-highlight">different parts</span> of your  <span class="text-highlight">mind</span> as an <span class="text-highlight">individual,</span> so that you can become adjust person within yourself and then act out that <span class="text-highlight">justice</span> in the outside world. So you know, that's a <span class="text-highlight">typical</span>, <span class="text-highlight">thought-provoking</span> <span class="text-highlight">answer</span> that he gives to a  <span class="text-highlight">fundamental</span>  <span class="text-highlight">question</span> . This is why we should read the Republic.`,

But there was that <span class="text-highlight">dream tucked away</span> inside of me to do this.

Finally, in the  <span class="text-highlight">early 90s</span> , I <span class="text-highlight">took</span>  my <span class="text-highlight">deep breath</span>  and started <span class="text-highlight">writing fiction</span>.

In <span class="text-highlight">fashion terms</span>, they are classed as ‘<span class="text-highlight">accessories</span>’ along with shoes, jewelry, handbags or watches. But in <span class="text-highlight">healthcare terms</span>, they are of course a <span class="text-highlight">medical device</span>.

    topic: "Light Bulbs or Energy Consumption",
    transcript: `This is a 40-watt <span class="text-highlight">light bulb</span>. If you leave it on all the time, it uses one kilowatt-hour every day. And it's possible to express all forms of <span class="text-highlight">power consumption</span> using  this unit of the light bulb. I started <span class="text-highlight">measuring</span> everything around my <span class="text-highlight">house</span>, around my <span class="text-highlight">office</span>. And I found some surprising things. First, a plug of a <span class="text-highlight">phone charger</span>. And it didn't even register on this power meter. It uses one hundredth of a light bulb of power. So I don’t think the <span class="text-highlight">phone charger</span> is gonna be our <span class="text-highlight">number one form</span> of <span class="text-highlight">energy consumption</span>. Just taking one  <span class="text-highlight">hot bath</span>  every day uses the  <span class="text-highlight">same energy</span> , <span class="text-highlight">same power</span> of five light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. And I found I've been steadily using 40 light bulbs worth of <span class="text-highlight">gas for heating</span>, making <span class="text-highlight">hot air</span> or <span class="text-highlight">hot water</span>. And that surprised me. <span class="text-highlight">Transport</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">one</span>  of the  <span class="text-highlight">biggest forms</span> of energy consumption, and it uses about a <span class="text-highlight">third</span> of our <span class="text-highlight">energy</span>. If you drive an average car 50 kilometers a day, that car forms too having 40 light bulbs on all the time. Today, the average <span class="text-highlight">British person</span>  is using 125 light bulbs of power. That’s 125 light bulbs on all the time, nonstop. That’s <span class="text-highlight">huge</span>.`,
    solution: `<p>The talk delineated a detailed picture regarding forms of energy consumption. The lecturer firstly provided many examples of power consumption by using the unit of the light bulb to measure everything around his house. In addition, he found that transport is one of the biggest forms of energy consumption. Finally, the aforementioned discussion emphasized the fact that British people are using a huge amount of power in their daily lives. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Fossil Fuels",
    transcript: `This is talk about <span class="text-highlight">visualizing life</span> without <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span>. We have an addiction to fossil fuels and it's not <span class="text-highlight">sustainable</span> when I say we. I'm talking about the so-called <span class="text-highlight">developed world</span>, the developed world gets 80 or 90% of all its <span class="text-highlight">energy</span> from <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> and living on fossil fuels for energy. In this way, it's  <span class="text-highlight">not sustainable</span>  for <span class="text-highlight">three</span> fairly obvious <span class="text-highlight">reasons</span>. First, on the left easily <span class="text-highlight">accessible</span> fossil fuels are a <span class="text-highlight">finite</span> <span class="text-highlight">resource</span> and so some point that <span class="text-highlight">resource</span> will be <span class="text-highlight">exploited</span> and humanity will have to do something else. Second, <span class="text-highlight">setting fire</span> to fossil fuels <span class="text-highlight">puts</span> <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide</span>  <span class="text-highlight">upstairs</span>. So, we have <span class="text-highlight">climate motivation</span>. The clear <span class="text-highlight">consensus</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">climate science</span>  <span class="text-highlight">community</span> is with substantial aero bars still on exactly what might happen. Their <span class="text-highlight">advice</span>  is this is a  <span class="text-highlight">geoengineering</span> <span class="text-highlight">experiment</span>that was well advised to <span class="text-highlight">stop</span>  <span class="text-highlight">as soon as possible</span>. And third, even if you don't believe in <span class="text-highlight">climate change</span> and even if global fossil fuels aren't running out today, it might be the case that your fossil fuels or our  <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> in a particular country or state have <span class="text-highlight">run out</span> and you might <span class="text-highlight">depend on</span> other <span class="text-highlight">countries</span> or  <span class="text-highlight">states</span> for fossil fuels in the <span class="text-highlight">future</span>. So, you have a security of  <span class="text-highlight">supply motivation</span> for saying let's <span class="text-highlight">look into</span>  really  <span class="text-highlight">getting off</span>  <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> in a  <span class="text-highlight">serious way</span>. I find  all three of these  <span class="text-highlight">motivations</span> are  <span class="text-highlight">equally</span> <span class="text-highlight">compelling</span> and I'm just going to take it as given now that we are interested in <span class="text-highlight">discussing</span> <span class="text-highlight">life</span> <span class="text-highlight">after fossil fuels</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about fossil fuels which are unsustainable in developed countries. He firstly indicated that accessible fossil fuels are finite and burning fossil fuels may lead to a significant increase in the amount of carbon dioxide. Moreover, he emphasized that a country may need to depend on other nations for fossil fuels in the future. Hence, the aforementioned discussion highlighted the significance of three motivations which are equally compelling. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `So, just over  <span class="text-highlight">ten years ago</span> , when I was in the Royal Academy, a  <span class="text-highlight">museum</span> in the centre of <span class="text-highlight">London</span>, with my <span class="text-highlight">three children</span>, at the Aztec <span class="text-highlight">exhibition</span>. I don’t know if any of you saw it. I had an <span class="text-highlight">older child</span> and two <span class="text-highlight">younger children</span>, <span class="text-highlight">twins</span>, strapped in a pushchair, and <span class="text-highlight">one</span>  of my  <span class="text-highlight">children</span>, three years old, <span class="text-highlight">shouted</span> and I’ve never denied he shouted  he shouted, ‘Monster,  monster!’  at this  <span class="text-highlight">statue</span> which looked just <span class="text-highlight">like a monster</span>, had <span class="text-highlight">snakes</span> for hair, a big beak for a nose. And, I thought, this is fantastic – I’ve got a three-year old that’s <span class="text-highlight">appreciating</span>  <span class="text-highlight">pre-Hispanic</span>  <span class="text-highlight">art</span> – how good can it get? <br/><br/> So, I bent down and I said, ‘Yes, it looks just like a monster’. And, at that moment, a room warden came over, a <span class="text-highlight">gallery assistant</span> came over and said we were being too <span class="text-highlight">noisy,</span> and <span class="text-highlight">threw us out</span>. Wrong family. I was, at that time, <span class="text-highlight">a journalist</span> with The <span class="text-highlight">Guardian</span>  <span class="text-highlight">newspaper</span>, and two days later <span class="text-highlight">wrote</span> a big piece in The Guardian about being  <span class="text-highlight">thrown out</span>  of the Royal Academy. What was really interesting was, by the end of that day, we had had, at the paper, over <span class="text-highlight">500 emails</span>  from other <span class="text-highlight">families</span> saying, ‘Museums aren’t working for us. Let’s try and make it work’. So, that’s what we did. In The Guardian, we <span class="text-highlight">set up</span>  a  <span class="text-highlight">campaign</span>. We called it <span class="text-highlight">the Kids in Museums</span>  <span class="text-highlight">campaign</span>, but it didn’t really exist. It was just a  <span class="text-highlight">few pages</span> . We ran  <span class="text-highlight">loads</span>  of  <span class="text-highlight">stories</span>  on it; I began touring the country talking about how to  <span class="text-highlight">make</span>  your  <span class="text-highlight">museum</span>  family  <span class="text-highlight">friendly</span>; I was a journalist. I was called in to see the then <span class="text-highlight">director</span> of the National Gallery in London, and I’ll <span class="text-highlight">never forget</span> this<span class="text-highlight">moment</span>, when he called me in and said, ‘We really like this Kids in Museums campaign, and we’ve been talking on our board about it, and we have  <span class="text-highlight">some ideas</span> of how we might  <span class="text-highlight">work together</span> , and I’d like you to take them back to your team.`,
    solution: `The talk delineated a detailed picture regarding a campaign named the Kids in Museums. She firstly raised current issues of the museum by introducing her experience of being thrown out of the Royal Academy. She also emphasized the importance of making museums friendlier to families.

    topic: "Animal behaviour (or Are We Animals)",
    transcript: `<p>Far too many people often say things like <span class="text-highlight">animals</span> do this but we don’t. Or this animal does this and that animal does this, but the <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> don't do things like that. Those <span class="text-highlight">statements</span> have some <span class="text-highlight">hidden</span>  <span class="text-highlight">assumption</span> that we are  <span class="text-highlight">not animals</span>.
When we say animals do this, animals do that, we often <span class="text-highlight">assume</span> that we are not animals. If we are not animals, what are we? Are we <span class="text-highlight">plants</span>or <span class="text-highlight">trees</span> or <span class="text-highlight">flowers</span>? No, we are not. Then okay, we are not plants. Are we <span class="text-highlight">microorganisms</span>, really  <span class="text-highlight">tiny</span>  <span class="text-highlight">microscopic</span>  things? No, we are not. Then the natural <span class="text-highlight">conclusion</span> must be we are not <span class="text-highlight">living things</span>.
That's not true. Yes, we are animals and I <span class="text-highlight">see animals</span>  in us and I see <span class="text-highlight">humans</span>  in  <span class="text-highlight">animals</span>. So I'm going to talk about <span class="text-highlight">animal behavior</span> and human nature in order to  <span class="text-highlight">understand</span>   <span class="text-highlight">human nature</span>.

The lecturer firstly talked about an assumption that people are different from animals, plants and even tiny microscopic things.

    topic: "Translator and Interpreter",
    transcript: `Hello, it's Megan. This week I'm going to talk about the <span class="text-highlight">difference</span>between <span class="text-highlight">translators</span> and <span class="text-highlight">interpreters</span>. It’s a <span class="text-highlight">common</span> <span class="text-highlight">misconception</span> that translators and interpreters <span class="text-highlight">do</span> the <span class="text-highlight">same</span>  <span class="text-highlight">thing</span>. So, I just like to highlight a few <span class="text-highlight">similarities</span> and <span class="text-highlight">differences</span> between the two. Firstly, translation refers to <span class="text-highlight">written communication</span> whereas interpreting refers to <span class="text-highlight">verbal communication</span>. So, for example, a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved. But would translate the written evidence used in the case. Secondly, both jobs <span class="text-highlight">require</span>  <span class="text-highlight">different skills</span>. I <span class="text-highlight">translate</span> to require the ability to <span class="text-highlight">write well</span> and <span class="text-highlight">comprehensively</span> into a <span class="text-highlight">target language</span>. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their <span class="text-highlight">native language</span>. For example, although I can <span class="text-highlight">speak French</span> to a <span class="text-highlight">good standard</span>. I cannot <span class="text-highlight">translate</span>  from <span class="text-highlight">English</span> to <span class="text-highlight">French</span> although I could translate from French to English, which means I’m only half way there to being an international player. An <span class="text-highlight">interpreter</span> needs to be able to <span class="text-highlight">speak</span> both <span class="text-highlight">languages</span>  <span class="text-highlight">proficiently</span>. Thirdly, the <span class="text-highlight">qualifications</span> and  <span class="text-highlight">experience</span> <span class="text-highlight">required</span> to become either a <span class="text-highlight">professional translator</span> or <span class="text-highlight">interpreter</span> do differ. Both roles  <span class="text-highlight">acquire</span> <span class="text-highlight">years</span>  of  <span class="text-highlight">training</span>, the resulting  <span class="text-highlight">qualification</span>. But what they can learn from the training Will be <span class="text-highlight">completely different</span>. So just to be clear <span class="text-highlight">translators</span> will <span class="text-highlight">translate</span> <span class="text-highlight">written texts</span> and <span class="text-highlight">interpreters</span> will translate a <span class="text-highlight">verbal communication</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the difference between translators and interpreters. She firstly introduced a common misconception that translators and interpreters do the same thing. In addition, she highlighted a few similarities and differences between the two by explaining that translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. In conclusion, she emphasized that the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. _(70 words)_`,

And according to a  <span class="text-highlight">study</span> from a <span class="text-highlight">British</span>   <span class="text-highlight">research</span> team published in the journal Nature, some like it hot. <span class="text-highlight">Bees</span> <span class="text-highlight">use up</span>  a lot of  <span class="text-highlight">energy</span> just <span class="text-highlight">stay</span> in <span class="text-highlight">warm</span> on some days. In fact, they <span class="text-highlight">can't</span> even <span class="text-highlight">fly</span> if they are <span class="text-highlight">too cold</span>. So, if one <span class="text-highlight">flower</span> is <span class="text-highlight">warmer</span> than another, a bee can  <span class="text-highlight">save</span> some of its <span class="text-highlight">fuel</span>  by  <span class="text-highlight">basking</span> on that flower while it's doing its <span class="text-highlight">pollinating</span> business. And it turns out that bumble bees  <span class="text-highlight">consistently</span> do <span class="text-highlight">choose</span>  <span class="text-highlight">warmer flowers</span> over  <span class="text-highlight">cooler</span> ones even when the two  <span class="text-highlight">flowers</span> <span class="text-highlight">offer</span>  up the <span class="text-highlight">same quantity</span> and quality of <span class="text-highlight">nectar</span>. Some plants seem to be <span class="text-highlight">evolutionarily</span> <span class="text-highlight">adapted</span> to be slightly <span class="text-highlight">warmer</span> because the warmer ones get  <span class="text-highlight">visited</span> more by the <span class="text-highlight">chilly</span>  <span class="text-highlight">bees</span>. When it comes to getting <span class="text-highlight">pollinated,</span> apparently the <span class="text-highlight">heat</span> is on. And that is the buzz.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the reason why the bumble bees pick some flowers over others. She firstly introduced that bees use color to recognize a flower's temperature. In addition, bees cannot fly if they are too cold or when they use up a lot of energy. Finally, bumble bees consistently choose warmer flowers over cooler ones even when the two flowers offer up the same quantity and quality of nectar. _(70 words)_`,

It is <span class="text-highlight">called</span> <span class="text-highlight">the Krebs cycle</span>, which some of you may remember from your  <span class="text-highlight">chemistry course</span> in your high school. Krebs is a<span class="text-highlight">wonderful</span> <span class="text-highlight">example</span> to me of how a  <span class="text-highlight">scientist</span> who is  <span class="text-highlight">determined</span> can <span class="text-highlight">overcome</span>  all kinds of <span class="text-highlight">human</span> <span class="text-highlight">obstacles</span>.

She was presumed to <span class="text-highlight">have infected 51 people</span>, three of whom died, over the course of <span class="text-highlight">her career as a cook</span>. She was twice forcibly isolated by <span class="text-highlight">public health authorities</span> and <span class="text-highlight">died after a total of nearly three decades in isolation</span>. <br /><br/>From 1900 to 1907, Mallon <span class="text-highlight">worked as a cook</span> in the New York City area for seven families. In 1900, she worked in Mamaroneck, New York, where, within two weeks of her employment, <span class="text-highlight">residents developed typhoid fever</span>. In 1901, she moved to Manhattan, where members of the family for whom she worked developed fevers and diarrhea, and the laundress died. Mallon then went to work for a lawyer; she left after seven of the eight people in that household became ill. <br/><br/> In 1906, she took a position in Oyster Bay, Long Island, and within two weeks 10 of the 11 family members were hospitalized with typhoid. <span class="text-highlight">She changed jobs</span> again, and similar occurrences happened in three more households. She worked as a cook for the family of a wealthy New York banker, Charles Henry Warren. When the Warrens rented a house in Oyster Bay for the summer of 1906, Mallon went along too. From August 27 to September 3, six of the 11 people in the family came down with <span class="text-highlight">typhoid fever</span>. <span class="text-highlight">The disease</span> at that time was <span class="text-highlight">“unusual”</span> in Oyster Bay, according to three <span class="text-highlight">medical doctors</span> who practiced there.`,

I think there is <span class="text-highlight">an intense competition</span> at the moment to hire <span class="text-highlight">the most talented</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the most intellectually able people</span>. There is a time when I think companies had many of the adventures in the world, that it was the company's world, it will be the bosses’ world. <br/> <br /> Now, I think the reverse is the case. We have <span class="text-highlight">a shortage of talent</span> both within countries and between countries: have <span class="text-highlight">intense battle between companies</span> trying to hire the most talented workers and also between countries which are looking to recruit <span class="text-highlight">talented young people</span>, <span class="text-highlight">talented young immigrants</span>. We have these senses of immigrants being things that countries are battling to keep out and immigrants trying to get in, climb over the walls. I think the opposite is, in fact, the case. And the topic is that countries are trying to woo bright young people to get them to go to the universities and get them to become immigrants. So, on many, many levels, time that is a premium, there is a shortage of talent.

    transcript: `I'm trying here to capture the dynamic that just conventionally been associated with <span class="text-highlight">urbanization development</span>. And it gets back once again to this question of <span class="text-highlight">agriculture</span>. Once you have cities you also as a reflection of cities, you have the countryside, you have <span class="text-highlight">rural areas</span> that have this relationship with <span class="text-highlight">urban areas</span> and at mediated by the production of <span class="text-highlight">agricultural goods</span>. And then the trade of those are increasingly <span class="text-highlight">industrial goods</span>. Increasing an agricultural productivity <span class="text-highlight">reduces labour needs and opportunities in rural areas</span>, pushing people towards the city's. There's this notion that in order to have progress and developments in cities, you need people. If everybody is busy growing crops, growing food to simply subsist, you can have people going into the city, you need to <span class="text-highlight">increase productivity in the countryside</span>. You need to have one farmer produce enough food more than one family. And then you will have growth and productivity in the countryside which will free up people to move to the cities. In fact, in many ways, it will compel them to <span class="text-highlight">move to the cities</span> because they won't be able to make a living in the countryside anymore.

    topic: "Globalization v1",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Globalization</span>, what is globalization?
I think that he takes on <span class="text-highlight">a few different definitions</span> in one sense of the word. Globalization means <span class="text-highlight">a proliferation of transactions across country</span>. So, one way of thinking about globalization is a way to describe, increase <span class="text-highlight">international communications</span>, more <span class="text-highlight">trade happening between countries</span> and  be less self-sufficient in <span class="text-highlight">providing goods and services</span> to their people and more companies that have offices in <span class="text-highlight">multiple countries</span>, which we call <span class="text-highlight">multinationals</span>. So, <span class="text-highlight">the source of growth in travel and communication</span> and corporate <span class="text-highlight">increases across borders</span>. And this way of thinking about globalization is the continuation of thinking that has been around for a long time, such as when the Europeans went to the Orient, to find spices, which was also an example of <span class="text-highlight">global trade and communication</span>. Another way to think of globalization though, is <span class="text-highlight">an economic system</span>. It is a system in which countries become <span class="text-highlight">integrated</span> in a way that never had been before. In this system, we see a global split in the process between <span class="text-highlight">consuming and producing goods</span>. Some countries produce goods, some countries, consumer goods, and then these countries in different areas of the globe depend on each other in a kind of organic solar directly rather than having an economic system being just inside your country. The system is the way economy in your country functions depends on economic economy of the country. And in fact this way of thinking about globalization's represents a new area of <span class="text-highlight">economic progression</span> the past industrially industrialist economy that has been <span class="text-highlight">a global issue</span>`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about globalization which is a proliferation of transactions across countries. Globalization involves international communications and trades happening between nations. It is by providing goods and services in multinationals, the source of growth in travel and communication increases significantly across borders. He finally indicated that the way of thinking about globalization represents a new area of economic progression in which countries of the globe depend on each other. (70 words)`,

    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Chromosomes</span> are found in the <span class="text-highlight">nucleus sub-cells</span>. The key factors are chromosomes contain a molecule <span class="text-highlight">DNA</span>. Scientist said that DNA is <span class="text-highlight">a genetic material</span> and not because our DNA determines our <span class="text-highlight">inherited features</span>. I’m showing you <span class="text-highlight">a structure of DNA</span> here. This is a simplified structure but it covers all the points that you need for combined science. DNA consists of <span class="text-highlight">two strands</span>, each strand is <span class="text-highlight">a polymer</span>. In another word, each strand is made by <span class="text-highlight">joining together lots of smaller molecules</span>. In DNA, the two strands are wrapped around each other to form a double helix. It’s really important that you learn the term double helix as it’s a very common exam question. So, as we said, DNA’s found in chromosomes. I’m showing you a picture of chromosome here. Now the key factors are <span class="text-highlight">the gene</span>, it’s the small section of DNA on the chromosome. And again, you need to learn that definition. So, I’m showing here a gene. For example, this could be the gene which determines your blood type. This gene is found on chromosome number nine. Each gene encoded for specific sequence of amino acid to make a specific protein. For example, the blood type gene encoded the sequence of amino acid for the protein that determines blood type. Now humans have literally thousands of genes. We’re going to finish now by looking at <span class="text-highlight">the genome</span>. The genome is <span class="text-highlight">the entire genetic material of an organism</span>. So, the human genome is the entire genetic material that makes a human.`,

So in terms of our <span class="text-highlight">total volume of water</span> in the world yesterday is <span class="text-highlight">changing</span>, but it's not changing significantly relative to the rate at which we are using or demanding fresh new water.
    Now, there are a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different areas of technology</span> involved in <span class="text-highlight">water recycling</span>. And we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewage. What about in the home at the moment what <span class="text-highlight">sort of technology</span> is being utilized in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well, very little on average, typically, in a modern home, we turn on the tap. We take a glass of water, we probably interning on that tab, flush 10 glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things. And there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a wastewater treatment plant. There is actually very, very little recycling <span class="text-highlight">at a local level</span>. People don't actually say: Well, I'm now going to take the water I just used, put it through a sophisticated process and reuse it and have a closed loop. It's not a closed loop in the home.`,

    Because this course is <span class="text-highlight">risk analysis</span>. So what do we mean by risk? And when you go to the dictionary and you look at the definition of risk, this is the definition of risk. What do you see is these definitions for example, a <span class="text-highlight">possibility of loss</span> or injury, a <span class="text-highlight">dangerous element</span>to factor the <span class="text-highlight">chance of loss</span>, the degree the <span class="text-highlight">probability</span> and so on. So <span class="text-highlight">risk has two parts</span> to it, as you look at the literal definition of risk is <span class="text-highlight">a consequence</span> of some kind, which has <span class="text-highlight">a danger</span>, has its loss.
    And the other aspect of it is <span class="text-highlight">probability</span>. Okay. So, even in the literal definition of risk, there are these two parts of <span class="text-highlight">chance</span> and <span class="text-highlight">consequence</span>. Okay. And then, at least as far as the English language is concerned, when you look up the word <span class="text-highlight">safe</span> <span class="text-highlight">safety</span>, what you notice is a little bit of a <span class="text-highlight">circular argument</span>, but <span class="text-highlight">free from risk</span> <span class="text-highlight">secure</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">danger</span>, <span class="text-highlight">condition of being safe</span>, and so on and so forth. And what I take out of that, at least at the level we're discussing today, when we're talking about safe, at least in English language, we're talking about an <span class="text-highlight">absolute</span> something is either safe or it's not safe.`,

    topic: "Implicit and Explicit Memory (or Memory)",
    transcript: `So I'm going to talk a little bit briefly about <span class="text-highlight">different systems of memory</span>. And in fact, much of the memory that <span class="text-highlight">influences</span> and <span class="text-highlight">guides</span> out our everyday life actually kind of <span class="text-highlight">hide in the background</span>, you actually don't know that when you're using the <span class="text-highlight">bulk of your memory.</span> And this is called <span class="text-highlight">implicit</span> or <span class="text-highlight">procedural</span> <span class="text-highlight">memory</span>. This includes things like <span class="text-highlight">cultural</span> and <span class="text-highlight">social</span> <span class="text-highlight">norms</span>. So kind of understanding how you're supposed to behave in a classroom or expecting a certain thing to happen when you walk into a restaurant. These are all things that we've learned and acquired over the years. But it's not necessarily something that we think about. language, also, in many aspects is something that is fairly <span class="text-highlight">automatic</span>, and that we've acquired and us very <span class="text-highlight">naturally</span> and other learned skills such as reading or driving, these are things that might have been <span class="text-highlight">effortful</span> at one time, but now they just come very <span class="text-highlight">easily</span> and <span class="text-highlight">automatically</span> to us. And in fact, if you actually try to describe to somebody how you drive, or how to drive, you actually kind of messes you up. So these are in a lot of women, a lot of cases, <span class="text-highlight">consciousness</span> kind of gets in the way of a lot of these aspects of influence memory. Now when we're talking about our memory, so for instance, people tell me a lot, that their memories are bad, when people are saying when they talk about their memory, they usually talking about <span class="text-highlight">explicit</span> or <span class="text-highlight">episodic</span> <span class="text-highlight">memory</span>. And these are very different from <span class="text-highlight">implicit memories</span>. These are memories that have a very <span class="text-highlight">specific tag</span> of <span class="text-highlight">space</span> and <span class="text-highlight">time</span>. These are highly <span class="text-highlight">personal memories</span>, usually. So this could be everything from remembering what you ate for breakfast to what you did on your last vacation or remembering a significant birthday that you had several years ago. Or in the past or, or just an answer to a multiple choice question on the test.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about differences between implicit and explicit memory. She firstly introduced the concept of procedural memory that influences and guides out our everyday life, but we do not know when using this type of memory.

    topic: "The Travels Sir John Mandeville",
    transcript: `But if you were to go to a library at the end of the 1300s, or through the 1400s, you would probably find a <span class="text-highlight">book</span> that was then, way more popular than those <span class="text-highlight">titles</span> we still read, a book that purported to be a <span class="text-highlight">description of the world</span>, a <span class="text-highlight">guide</span> the traveling and distant lands of BC area and Almanac of everything that was just off the horizon. I am not talking about Marco Polo. No, I'm talking about something far far, weirder and far, far less tethered to reality, a volume of medieval fantasy masquerading as a field guide called <span class="text-highlight">The travels of Sir John Mandeville</span>, supposedly the titular night set out from England in the 1330s and embarked on a journey that would take him to the <span class="text-highlight">Middle East</span>, <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Asia</span>, though as it will become apparent, not a Middle East, not in Africa and not an Asia that we would recognize here in reality. No Mandeville spoke. It's not really about actually real foreign lands. It's about what <span class="text-highlight">Europeans</span> thought was just outside the <span class="text-highlight">bounds of their civilizations</span>. It's about what's beyond that mountain range that marks the borders of the lands. You know, it's about what medieval people thought the foreign looks like. And all of its is <span class="text-highlight">mysterious</span>, alluring and intimidating, <span class="text-highlight">unknown</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about a popular book that purported to be a description of the world and a guide to travelling. He firstly indicated this book was weirder and less tethered to reality. Additionally, the volume was written when he set out from England and embarked on a long journey to distant lands.

    topic: "History of English",
    transcript: `So the title of my lecture today is Heinz 57, the <span class="text-highlight">history of English</span> and the <span class="text-highlight">rise of English</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">global language</span>. I know that John Slack gave you a lecture on English, the global language that right you've had to run. Oh, he's going to say, the end of my lecture will lead on to what John Slack's going to talk to you about next time. So there'll be a link, and I've called my lecture, Heinz 57. Because English, as you've already read, is, is <span class="text-highlight">not a pure language</span>. I don't think there really are any pure languages in the world. But English is definitely not a pure language. English, in fact, has <span class="text-highlight">borrowed</span> from over <span class="text-highlight">350 languages</span> in its history. So it's a <span class="text-highlight">variety of many languages</span>. Some people say it's like a dog, a Mongol dog, a dog that's been made up of many different dogs. The English language is like that. And by looking at the <span class="text-highlight">history of the English language</span>, we learn about the <span class="text-highlight">history of the English people</span>, the two things are <span class="text-highlight">closely connected</span>. So in fact, today, we're not <span class="text-highlight">learning about language</span>, but we're <span class="text-highlight">learning about history</span>. And fact, the English has borrowed words from over 350 languages, has been <span class="text-highlight">viewed differently</span> throughout history. So for example, in <span class="text-highlight">Shakespeare's time</span>, people were very <span class="text-highlight">angry</span> about words which were not they thought <span class="text-highlight">original English words</span> - words, which came from other languages they didn't like them. During <span class="text-highlight">times of war</span> for is, for example, World War II, German words were they tried to remove German words from the English language, but as we'll see from the lecture today, that was very difficult because the <span class="text-highlight">basis of English</span> lies in <span class="text-highlight">Germanic languages</span>, so it was very hard to remove all German words from the English language.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the history of English and the rise of English as a global language. She firstly indicated that English is not a pure language. In addition, she indicated that English has borrowed from over 350 languages in its history. Finally, she emphasized that the fact that English has borrowed words from over 350 languages has been viewed differently throughout history _(64 words)_`,

    topic: "Where Earthquakes occur?",
    transcript: `So we have a <span class="text-highlight">fault plane</span>, and then the <span class="text-highlight">earthquake</span> itself <span class="text-highlight">occurred</span> on this fault plane, the earthquake starts at a particular point on the fault plane. And we call that the <span class="text-highlight">focus of the earthquake</span>.  And then the <span class="text-highlight">rupture</span> <span class="text-highlight">propagates out</span> from that point on the <span class="text-highlight">rupture plane</span> to <span class="text-highlight">cover the entire fault plane</span>. That ruptures in that particular earthquake. We talked about the <span class="text-highlight">epicenter of an earthquake</span> a lot, the epicenter is just the <span class="text-highlight">surface projection</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">focus of the earthquake</span>. So if we wanted to look in <span class="text-highlight">map view</span> of where the earthquake was located, and we were able to look down into the earth, we would see the focus down at some depth on the earth, and the epicenter is just the point <span class="text-highlight">vertically above</span> that focus at the <span class="text-highlight">surface of the earth</span>. Okay. So this is the <span class="text-highlight">relationship between fault and earthquakes</span>. This <span class="text-highlight">block model</span> that you can see here is the same block model that we were just looking at, it's a <span class="text-highlight">thrust fault</span> of some kind. So we have rupture on this thrust fault. And as a result of that rupture, we see a <span class="text-highlight">seismic wave</span> <span class="text-highlight">radiated away</span> from the fault, so we get this <span class="text-highlight">displacement</span> on the fault and <span class="text-highlight">radiated seismic ways</span> away from the fault.`,

I would argue that globalization matters, because it means the <span class="text-highlight">rise of interconnectedness</span> between countries and markets across the world. For example, one of the reasons why the <span class="text-highlight">financial crash</span> of 2007 2008 was so <span class="text-highlight">serious</span> was because the <span class="text-highlight">financial and banking systems</span> of countries around the world have become so <span class="text-highlight">closely interconnected</span> with the globalization.`,

Now, there are many <span class="text-highlight">definitions of creativity</span>, perhaps almost as many of people who study it, but here's my address of a common type of statement. Creativity refers to the <span class="text-highlight">phenomenon</span> whereby <span class="text-highlight">human activity generates something new</span>, that has <span class="text-highlight">some kind of value</span>. And thinking about this, some people talk about the <span class="text-highlight">three P's</span>: the <span class="text-highlight">creative person</span>, the <span class="text-highlight">creative process</span>, and the <span class="text-highlight">creative product</span>.

Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And for me, that's absolutely the <span class="text-highlight">pleasure</span> and even on good days, <span class="text-highlight">the joy of doing organization studies</span>, because it enables you not just enables, but requires you, in some sense, to have some kind of <span class="text-highlight">broad familiarization</span> of that sort. Now, there's a price to be paid for that. Because that kind of breadth, if you like, though I suppose that the <span class="text-highlight">cost of depth</span>, and I guess there would be people who are clearly within<span class="text-highlight">academic disciplines</span> of <span class="text-highlight">sociology</span> or <span class="text-highlight">economics</span>or whatever, who might say, well, these are sort of magpie-sh, amateurish kind of forays into our territory.

And so, I think it's a <span class="text-highlight">liberating idea</span>, the idea that we don't need to be <span class="text-highlight">bound by those strictures and structures of disciplinary division</span>, and that we can be <span class="text-highlight">free actually to imagine and think about the social world</span> through an <span class="text-highlight">agglomeration of techniques and ideas</span> and <span class="text-highlight">theories and concepts</span> from across the <span class="text-highlight">social sciences</span>.`,

    transcript: `There can now be no <span class="text-highlight">reasonable, science-based doubt</span> about the reality of <span class="text-highlight">global climate change effects</span> brought on by the <span class="text-highlight">cumulative and rapidly growing emission</span> of so-called <span class="text-highlight">"greenhouse" gases</span> - primarily <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide</span> - into the atmosphere. As these effects become <span class="text-highlight">increasingly more obvious</span> worldwide, so commercial interests, <span class="text-highlight">groups of concerned individuals and national governments</span> have been gripped by what amounts to mass panic about what to do about it.<br/><br/> To many, Paul Ehrlich's Malthusian "Population Bomb" of 1968 appears about to explode in the world's face in an indirect version of his millenarian vision of <span class="text-highlight">population growth</span> which <span class="text-highlight">outpaces agricultural production capacity</span> - with predictably <span class="text-highlight">catastrophic results for humanity</span>. And his three-part crisis scenario does indeed seem now to be present: a <span class="text-highlight">rapid rate of change</span>, a limit of some sort, and <span class="text-highlight">delays in perceiving that limit</span>. Ehrlich's work was roundly criticised at the time, and later, from many quarters, and much of what he predicted did not come about. Nevertheless, can the world afford to take the risk that the <span class="text-highlight">climate scientists have got it wrong</span>? Is it not in everyone's interests to apply the Precautionary Principle in attempting to avoid the worst of their predictions - now, rather than at some future time? As the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Mr. Rajendra Pachauri, has recently pointed out, <span class="text-highlight">eleven of the warmest years since instrumental records began have occurred in the past twelve</span>, while <span class="text-highlight">major precipitation changes are taking place</span> on a global scale.`,

    topic: "Design of buildings",
    transcript: `Just think of the various <span class="text-highlight">catastrophic failures of Victorian architecture</span> that stood and fail. Here is the disastrous Milbank penitentiary, great prison built underside of Tate Britain, our predecessors let this go. And we now <span class="text-highlight">look back with the same sense of self of relief</span>. Thank goodness we don't have to spend our time <span class="text-highlight">keeping that particular monstrosity standing</span>. But here, I think we come to an incredibly important point.
    When we're dealing with buildings of the Victorian era or earlier, <span class="text-highlight">we're looking at a building stock that has already been rid of the architectural flops</span>. There's been a <span class="text-highlight">process of natural selection</span> in which at thousands of <span class="text-highlight">buildings</span> that were built or designed poorly have already fallen down or <span class="text-highlight">have already been modified and the faults rectified</span>. But <span class="text-highlight">when we're dealing with buildings that are only 50 or 60 years old</span>, <span class="text-highlight">we are often confronting design flaws or poor workmanship</span> that are only just coming to light or only just in the <span class="text-highlight">process of being rectified</span>. This, again, challenges our <span class="text-highlight">perception of authenticity</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Most historic buildings</span> (by which I mean buildings a hundred years or more old) <span class="text-highlight">have been adapted and modified to iron out design and construction flaws</span> and so their so-called original state is, in fact, an altered state in which they perform well, in fact often better than when they were first completed. Late twentieth century buildings are still going through this Darwinian process of natural selection that will decide whether they will survive having been adapted or whether they will die as being unsuited to their function. So <span class="text-highlight">criticizing them for their design flaws may be seen as unfair</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about various catastrophic failures of Victorian architecture that stood and fell.

We're not into a generic soap, we're into the best, you know, stain removing laundry detergent you're going to buy. But we're going to want you to remember that as the tide brand, now, that means there's a second moment of truth. If they do select you and they pay 50% more than they want to pay for Walmart's brand when they get home, it’d better perform when it's used. And here's where the science starts, folks. There's an amazing <span class="text-highlight">number of fundamental engineering contradictions</span>, right?<br/>
    Airplanes deal with you know, <span class="text-highlight">weight and strength</span>. I want something that's <span class="text-highlight">light, but strong</span>. That's an engineering contradiction.<br/>
    Once I deal with our things, you have to be <span class="text-highlight">strong and soft</span>. They have to be strong even when they're wet.

So take a look at these four panels.

They're all based on cells <span class="text-highlight">cells are the fundamental building blocks of all life</span>.

And one way in which you're a supermodel historians is therefore in focus in terms of <span class="text-highlight">how we interrogate the past</span>, <span class="text-highlight">what elements we use to communicate in the past</span>. Most <span class="text-highlight">academic historians</span>, I trained very much in discipline of words, and they concentrate on words still today. I think all that's changing a little bit. If you go through university history, I think primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like <span class="text-highlight">archival accounts</span>, <span class="text-highlight">manuscripts</span>. Now <span class="text-highlight">oral history</span>, <span class="text-highlight">historians</span>, oral histories, and <span class="text-highlight">most of that work is actually promulgated in the form of books</span>.

Typically <span class="text-highlight">when the seven-month-old baby is used to particular setting</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the situation switches</span> <span class="text-highlight">it takes them a little while to regroup</span>. So turned out that seven-month-old Italian and seven-month-old Slovenian babies would <span class="text-highlight">get used to the puppet appearing on the right</span>, and then <span class="text-highlight">when the puppet would appear on the left they would continue looking to the right as if nothing had changed</span>. Whereas <span class="text-highlight">the bilingual babies very quickly would turn their head and notice that the puppet has changed its position</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed a study on three groups of babies from Italia, Slovenia and mixed marriages. She firstly explained that they showed them various puppets and switched the situation. Additionally, Slovenian and Italian babies would get used to the puppet appearing on the right and continue looking to the right when it appeared on the left. However, the bilingual babies would quickly turn their head, and notice the changed position.`,

    topic: "Why study law?",
    transcript: `<p>My name is Graham Virgo, I’m Professor of English Private Law in the Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge, and I’m going to consider the question <span class="text-highlight">why you should study law if you don’t want to become a lawyer</span>.
    A lot of people who study Law at University do so because they want to become <span class="text-highlight">practising lawyers</span>, whether <span class="text-highlight">barristers or solicitors</span>.
    But <span class="text-highlight">it is not necessary to read Law at University to become a practising lawyer</span>.
    Equally, <span class="text-highlight">studying Law at University is a legitimate subject for academic study</span> even if you definitely do not want to become a lawyer or think that you may not become a practising lawyer.
    That is because <span class="text-highlight">the study of Law at University is not a vocational subject</span>; it is an <span class="text-highlight">academic subject and an intellectual discipline</span>. Even those students who study Law at University intending to become practising lawyers <span class="text-highlight">are required to do additional vocational training</span> to prepare them for working either as a barrister or a solicitor; for them <span class="text-highlight">the study of Law at University by itself is not sufficient to train them to become lawyers.</span>
    So why do such students study law at University and why do others study Law even if they don’t want to become a lawyer?
    The answer is fairly similar in both cases, namely that studying Law at University trains the student to think and write logically and clearly.</p>`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed the question why students should study law even they do not want to become a lawyer. He firstly explained that if students want to become practising lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, they need to do additional vocational training. Additionally, law is a legitimate subject for academic study and an intellectual discipline. He finally concluded that studying law trains the student to think and write logically and clearly. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `<p>Because <span class="text-highlight">New Zealand is super diverse</span> right now, predominantly in Auckland, but actually throughout New Zealand here, we're already 50% Mari Pacifica and Asian 44% are not born in New Zealand and we have over 200 ethnicities. Now <span class="text-highlight">the definition academically of super diversity</span> is 25% not born in New Zealand 100 ethnicities. So <span class="text-highlight">we are almost double that number already</span>. And <span class="text-highlight">Auckland will continue to become younger and browner</span> as the Anglo Saxon population ages and shrinks. So <span class="text-highlight">the mega trend here is not age</span>. And the myth the mega trend here is not urbanisation <span class="text-highlight">the mega trend is demography</span>. It's a necessity. And we need to get our head around that because most of the benefits from Super diversity that we as a country are enjoying at the moment, such as <span class="text-highlight">greater innovation, productivity and advancement increase New Zealand's financial capital</span>, whereas <span class="text-highlight">most of the challenges from Super diversity adversely affect New Zealand social capital</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecture delineated the New Zealand’s super diverse future and the status quo of this diversity, predominantly in Auckland. She firstly claimed that most of the challenges from super diversity adversely affect New Zealand social capital. Additionally, she argued that if people do not mitigate the challenges to use social capital, they are not going to maximise sustainably. She finally concluded that the diversity dividend benefits for your financial capital. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Fast Radio Bursts",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Fast radio burst</span> is very much like what it sounds, it's a burst, it's a very <span class="text-highlight">fast burst of radio waves comes from outer space long way away</span>. And by fast, I mean really fast. So <span class="text-highlight">it's starts and stops in about a thousandth of a second</span>. So you click your fingers and it's finished.
    First <span class="text-highlight">radio goes to a real mystery</span>, we <span class="text-highlight">don't really understand exactly where they come from, or what actually makes them</span>. And there's a lot of open questions that we really don't have an answer for. There are probably more theories about what makes Australia but then there are actually actual detections of these things. So since 2007, we've only had 20. But there are probably 30 or 40 different theories on what makes them. The most interesting thing about this burst is the fact that we found that we Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, so that is, it wasn't really obvious that we will be able to do this, as well as we ended up being able to do it. So. So <span class="text-highlight">this telescope is really a fantastic telescope</span>. In fact, <span class="text-highlight">it's probably the best telescope on the planet at the moment for finding these bursts</span>.
    And so whereas in the past, it's taken 1010 years to find 20 bursts, once we're really going with this new instrument will be able to find them much more quickly whenever you can do one or two every week, and that will blow up in the field. So that will make it a much more. You know, <span class="text-highlight">we'll be able to do much more detailed studies of these things</span>, <span class="text-highlight">get better statistics</span>, understand what that hopefully <span class="text-highlight">understand what they are and where they're coming from</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecture delineated the concept of fast radio bursts coming from outer space. He firstly indicated that it is challenging to understand exactly where they come from or what actually makes them. Additionally, he explained different theories based on the findings from fantastic telescopes. He finally concluded that people need to conduct more detailed studies and get better statistics to understand what radio bursts are and where they come from. _(70 words)_`,

Sure, you can see <span class="text-highlight">examples</span> here of the wheel, or the <span class="text-highlight">automobile</span>. That the inventions I'm talking about are the <span class="text-highlight">domestic appliances</span> that <span class="text-highlight">allowed</span> for <span class="text-highlight">increased</span> <span class="text-highlight">leisure time</span>, and redefined <span class="text-highlight">gender roles</span> in <span class="text-highlight">society</span> to a degree as <span class="text-highlight">never seen before</span> in <span class="text-highlight">human history</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">evolution</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">washing machine</span>, as demonstrated in this barn is a <span class="text-highlight">representative example</span> of this <span class="text-highlight">changing domestic life</span>. For many centuries, <span class="text-highlight">sailors</span> used to place their clothing in a cloth bag, tie the back to a rope and throw it overboard, letting the ship drag it for hours. The principle was simple, force water through the clothes to remove the dirt. But in the household before running <span class="text-highlight">water</span> and <span class="text-highlight">electricity</span>,
    Washington close to a staggering amount of labour
    to <span class="text-highlight">wash</span>, boil and rent a single load of <span class="text-highlight">clothes</span> to take care gallons of water, which had to be hand carried from my pump or well, hand wringing, rubbing and lifting the clothes could <span class="text-highlight">expose</span> <span class="text-highlight">women</span> to <span class="text-highlight">caustic substances</span> in the setups. The whole <span class="text-highlight">process</span> for <span class="text-highlight">households laundry</span> could take an <span class="text-highlight">entire day</span> or more as back breaking labour, and 1846, a <span class="text-highlight">patented washing machine</span> imitated the <span class="text-highlight">human hand</span> moving cloth over a washboard by using a lever to rub the clothes between two red surfaces. This machine was sold in the US as late as 1927.

What would How would you really <span class="text-highlight">enjoy spending your life?</span> Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of <span class="text-highlight">educational system</span>. Crowds of students say, Well, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">painters</span>, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">poets</span>. We'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">writers</span>, but as everybody knows, you can't done any money that way.

    I said you want to teach in riding school?
    Let's go through with it. <span class="text-highlight">What do you want</span>?
    When we finally got down with something which the individual says he <span class="text-highlight">really wants to do</span>?
    I will say to him, you do that? And <span class="text-highlight">forget</span> the money.

    topic: "Wildlife in Africa",
    transcript: `In my view, it's impossible to talk about <span class="text-highlight">wildlife</span> and not think about it roughly in 9 years. And I guess part of that is my own <span class="text-highlight">angle</span> and part of the research that I do in <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span>, in both East and West Africa, I look at the role of the <span class="text-highlight">human reliance</span> on wildlife as a <span class="text-highlight">source of food</span>, and also as a <span class="text-highlight">source of income.</span> Can we talk about our wildlife <span class="text-highlight">at sea</span> and we talk about <span class="text-highlight">fish</span>, we're talking about what's probably the <span class="text-highlight">single most important</span> <span class="text-highlight">source of protein</span>for <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">across the globe</span>. So, millions for more than a billion people <span class="text-highlight">rely on fish</span> is their <span class="text-highlight">primary source</span> of <span class="text-highlight">animal protein</span>. And most of these people are living in <span class="text-highlight">poverty</span>. So, the <span class="text-highlight">management</span> of fish resources, wildlife in that sense is of course <span class="text-highlight">incredibly important</span> and livelihoods and health. And also, <span class="text-highlight">wildlife tourism</span> is a multi billion <span class="text-highlight">dollar industry</span> and in many <span class="text-highlight">countries</span>, such as Africa and <span class="text-highlight">South America</span>, and it can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one source of income</span>. It can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one</span> source of <span class="text-highlight">foreign income</span> for <span class="text-highlight">economies</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about wildlife in Africa and the role of human reliance on wildlife as a source of food and income. He firstly argued that many people relying on fish as the primary source of protein are living in poverty. In addition, he suggested that management of fish resources is incredibly important. He finally concluded that wildlife tourism can be the number one source of foreign income for economies. _(70 words)_.`,

    topic: "Music and the brain",
    transcript: `Interest in <span class="text-highlight">music</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">mind</span> is as ancient as philosophy itself. Plato was marveled at the <span class="text-highlight">power of music</span> over human character and <span class="text-highlight">human emotions</span>, in fact, he was quite concerned about the <span class="text-highlight">way</span> music could either <span class="text-highlight">degrade</span> or <span class="text-highlight">elevate</span> the minds of <span class="text-highlight">young people</span> so you can see in some sense nothing has changed. He said <span class="text-highlight">rhythm</span> and <span class="text-highlight">harmony</span> find their way into the <span class="text-highlight">inward places</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">soul</span> well yes that's true and he said this in 400 BC, but what has changed since then. It's just in the last few years <span class="text-highlight">brain science</span> has started to seriously <span class="text-highlight">investigate</span> music, and this <span class="text-highlight">young science</span> is confirming music's <span class="text-highlight">power over</span> us. For example, some colleagues in Montreal <span class="text-highlight">decided to do</span> a <span class="text-highlight">study</span> to <span class="text-highlight">investigate</span> what <span class="text-highlight">happens in the brain</span> when people <span class="text-highlight">get chills to music</span> this is intense <span class="text-highlight">emotional responses</span> that often <span class="text-highlight">manifest themselves as shivers</span> tingling of the spines anybody here had this okay it's not <span class="text-highlight">uncommon</span> and they specifically looked at chills - <span class="text-highlight">instrumental music</span> so this wasn't due to any associations that people had with <span class="text-highlight">lyrics</span> it was just <span class="text-highlight">sounds of music</span> and they looked at they <span class="text-highlight">took advantage</span> of the fact that people often know quite well what <span class="text-highlight">music gives them chills</span> they know the piece sometimes the very passage in the piece and so they had people <span class="text-highlight">bring</span> in their own <span class="text-highlight">self-selected</span> <span class="text-highlight">CDs</span> and they <span class="text-highlight">scan</span> their brains while they were having these <span class="text-highlight">experiences</span> <span class="text-highlight">listening to music</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer delineated the power of music over human character and human emotions. He firstly concerned about the way music degraded or elevated the minds of young people. Additionally, he discussed rhythm and harmony find their ways into the inward places of the soul and brain science has started to seriously investigate music. He finally introduced studies in investigating what happens in the brain when people get chills to music. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "William Shakespeare (or Shakespeare's Poem)",
    transcript: `Let's think about perhaps the <span class="text-highlight">top 10 things</span> that people <span class="text-highlight">would like to know</span>, ought to know about <span class="text-highlight">Shakespeare</span>. But if they're getting into <span class="text-highlight">his works</span>.  First thing to say is that he <span class="text-highlight">did live quite a long time</span> ago he lived 400 years ago. So if you're <span class="text-highlight">reading Shakespeare</span> or <span class="text-highlight">listening</span> to Shakespeare, you're listening to <span class="text-highlight">somebody</span> whose <span class="text-highlight">language</span> is not quite the language of our <span class="text-highlight">current</span>, by current, you're listening to someone who <span class="text-highlight">was writing in a language</span>, which is a bit <span class="text-highlight">out of date</span> for now. It needs a little bit of <span class="text-highlight">effort</span> to <span class="text-highlight">understand</span> that language but <span class="text-highlight">the understanding will be done</span> partly for you by the actors if you're hearing it but if you're seeing it performed. Another thing is that Shakespeare was a very <span class="text-highlight">great poet</span> he wrote <span class="text-highlight">poems</span> are at <span class="text-highlight">narrative poems</span> and <span class="text-highlight">sonnets</span>, but he was also and this is my third point, he was also a great <span class="text-highlight">theatre poet</span> his poetry is <span class="text-highlight">dramatic poetry</span> in the plays. He's not just writing <span class="text-highlight">static poetry</span> lyric poetry in the plays which is therefore <span class="text-highlight">declamation</span>. He's writing <span class="text-highlight">dramatic poetry</span> which <span class="text-highlight">consists of</span> <span class="text-highlight">interaction</span> between the <span class="text-highlight">characters</span> <span class="text-highlight">of the plays</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about major things about Shakespeare, who lived a long time ago. Firstly, he explained that it requires efforts to understand Shakespeare’s language because it is out of date for now to read and listen. Additionally, Shakespeare was a great poet writing narrative poems and sonnets. Finally, he was also a great theatre poet, who wrote dramatic poetry that consists of interaction between the characters of the plays. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Drinking water",
    transcript: `Do you <span class="text-highlight">drink</span> <span class="text-highlight">enough water</span>? This is all <span class="text-highlight">water intake</span>. The, the <span class="text-highlight">old theory</span> was that we were <span class="text-highlight">supposed to</span> drink <span class="text-highlight">eight cups of water</span>. But that's, that's an <span class="text-highlight">old wives tale</span>. If we drink four <span class="text-highlight">cups</span> of water and take four cups of water in, we are eating <span class="text-highlight">lettuce</span> we eat <span class="text-highlight">pasta</span>, we eat <span class="text-highlight">soup</span>, we eat <span class="text-highlight">cup of coffee</span>, some latte, you know, we have all kinds, so we have all kinds of <span class="text-highlight">fluid</span> inside. So four cups of liquid, four cups of water in the <span class="text-highlight">food</span>. We generate about one and <span class="text-highlight">a half cups of water</span> just for <span class="text-highlight">metabolism</span>. You remember way back to the metabolism. Break down of carbohydrate yields <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide energy</span>, water, right down approach use carbon dioxide, energy, water nitrogen, breakdown every <span class="text-highlight">nutrient yields water</span>. That's <span class="text-highlight">what this water is</span>. So that's part of the <span class="text-highlight">water balance</span> .We are <span class="text-highlight">intake</span> is equivalent to <span class="text-highlight">approximately</span> <span class="text-highlight">ten cups</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer raised a question of whether people drink enough water. She firstly contested the old theory indicating that people were supposed to drink eight cups of water. Additionally, she stated that people should drink four cups of water and other four cups of water in food, namely lettuce, soup or coffee, to generate enough water for metabolism. She finally concluded that carbohydrates yield carbon dioxide, energy and water.`,

    transcript: `I think we are in the <span class="text-highlight">early stages</span> of a <span class="text-highlight">change</span> toward much more <span class="text-highlight">human freedom</span> in <span class="text-highlight">business</span>. And I think this change may be as <span class="text-highlight">important</span> for businesses, as the change to <span class="text-highlight">democracy</span> has been for <span class="text-highlight">governments</span>. The reason I think that's happening is because it's now possible for the first time in <span class="text-highlight">human history,</span> to have the <span class="text-highlight">economic benefits</span> of very large <span class="text-highlight">organisations</span>, things like <span class="text-highlight">economies of scale</span> and <span class="text-highlight">knowledge</span>, and at the same time, to have the human benefits of small organisations, things like <span class="text-highlight">freedom</span>, <span class="text-highlight">flexibility</span>, <span class="text-highlight">creativity</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">motivation</span>. The reason I think that's possible, is because <span class="text-highlight">Information Technology</span> has now <span class="text-highlight">reduced</span> the <span class="text-highlight">cost of communication</span> to such a low level, that it's now possible for huge numbers of people, even in very large organisations, to have <span class="text-highlight">enough information</span> to <span class="text-highlight">make sensible decisions</span> for themselves. Instead of just following <span class="text-highlight">orders</span> from someone above them, who <span class="text-highlight">supposedly</span> <span class="text-highlight">knows more than they do</span> in a <span class="text-highlight">management hierarchy</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the early stages of a change toward human freedom in business. He firstly explained the economic benefits of both large and small organisations. Additionally, he introduced new concepts including economies of scale and knowledge, freedom, flexibility, creativity, and motivation. He finally concluded that Information Technology has reduced the cost of communication, and huge numbers of people can have enough information to make sensible decisions for themselves. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Human Memory",
    transcript: `For millennia for us, <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">forgetting's been</span> easy, spilled into us. Biologically, we <span class="text-highlight">forget</span> most of <span class="text-highlight">what we experience</span> every day our feelings, our thoughts. <span class="text-highlight">Remembering</span> is <span class="text-highlight">hard</span>. Since <span class="text-highlight">the beginning of time</span> we humans have tried to <span class="text-highlight">overcome</span> <span class="text-highlight">biological forgetting</span>, and to <span class="text-highlight">hold on to memories</span> that are <span class="text-highlight">precious</span>. For thousands of years, we have tried like this Navajo to <span class="text-highlight">pass on</span> our <span class="text-highlight">memories</span> to our children, and the hope that they to made us be able to remember this is how the <span class="text-highlight">great</span> <span class="text-highlight">epics of the world</span> emerged thousands of years ago.

    solution: `The lecturer talked about human memory, which is not fixed because it changes when people reconstruct the past. He firstly explained that human forgetting is easy while remembering is hard. Additionally, humans have tried to overcome biological forgetting of what we experience everyday, and to hold on to memories that are precious.

    topic: "Face recognition",
    transcript: `Last week, we talked about <span class="text-highlight">how people</span> <span class="text-highlight">recognise</span> <span class="text-highlight">objects</span>. And really <span class="text-highlight">how well people recognise objects</span>, given <span class="text-highlight">how difficult the problem</span> is, given how objects can be seen in all different sorts of <span class="text-highlight">illumination</span> in <span class="text-highlight">different positions</span> in <span class="text-highlight">different angles</span>. And yet, we're able to <span class="text-highlight">extract that information</span>, we're able to take the <span class="text-highlight">the visual stuff</span> out there, <span class="text-highlight">interpret</span> it in a way that allows us to <span class="text-highlight">recognise all the different things</span> that we can see in our environment.<br/><br/>
    Today, we're going to kind of <span class="text-highlight">carry on</span> looking at that, but we're going to look at what's really a special class of objects. That's the <span class="text-highlight">human face</span>. So we're going to look at <span class="text-highlight">how we recognise human faces</span> and how we do it quite as well as we do. We're really experts at <span class="text-highlight">recognising faces</span>. So again, we can think about how do we take that <span class="text-highlight">visual information</span>? And how do we <span class="text-highlight">transform</span> it into a form which allows us to <span class="text-highlight">put a name to a face</span>, and to do all the other <span class="text-highlight">clever things</span> that we can do with faces. So I'm going to start off again, by just sort of pointing out that it's a <span class="text-highlight">hard problem</span>, face recognition is a hard problem. And it's a <span class="text-highlight">clever thing</span> that we do. If you think about all the <span class="text-highlight">different types of faces</span> that you can recognise, and all the <span class="text-highlight">different types of information</span> that you can get from the face. You kind of start to <span class="text-highlight">appreciate</span> how well we can do face recognition. So you can look at a face and you can find out its <span class="text-highlight">identity</span>. So you can <span class="text-highlight">look at this sort of set</span> of all these different types of faces and you'll be able to recognise some of those people. You can tell things about their <span class="text-highlight">age</span>, about their <span class="text-highlight">gender</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about how well people recognise objects given how objects can be seen in different positions and angles. He firstly introduced how to extract information and interpret it in a way to recognise all the different things. Additionally, he explained how people can transform the visual information of human faces. Finally, while looking at a face, people can find out its identity, and tell things about their gender. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `Studying <span class="text-highlight">law</span> at <span class="text-highlight">university</span> over the <span class="text-highlight">three years</span> will allow you to <span class="text-highlight">acquire</span> a greater and much more <span class="text-highlight">in-depth</span> <span class="text-highlight">understanding</span> of not only the law but <span class="text-highlight">the way it rules work</span>, <span class="text-highlight">the way to think about law</span> and this knowledge can have a real benefit for you in your <span class="text-highlight">future career</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">lawyer</span>. Law is also a brilliant <span class="text-highlight">academic subject</span> to study in its own right. Even if you don't want to be lawyer it can provide a fantastic foundation for a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different future careers</span>. Why? Because it <span class="text-highlight">involves</span> not only <span class="text-highlight">studying and applying</span> the rules in an analytical way, but it goes a lot further than that. Law <span class="text-highlight">involves</span> a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different subjects</span>. We think about why a <span class="text-highlight">particular rule</span> exists, we think about whether <span class="text-highlight">this rule</span> can be <span class="text-highlight">justified</span> <span class="text-highlight">philosophically</span>. We think about <span class="text-highlight">how the law</span>has appliedhistorically<span class="text-highlight">. We think about what kind of</span>social goods<span class="text-highlight">we are promoting by implementing this</span>particular law<span class="text-highlight">and then think, “Okay, so</span>how can we take<span class="text-highlight">all this, put it together and talk about</span>how the law should evolve in the future?”`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about benefits of studying law at university to acquire a greater and more in-depth understanding of the way rules work. She firstly explained that law can provide a fantastic foundation for many different future careers. Additionally,law involves studying and applying the rules in an analytical way. Finally, she raised questions about</span>how the law should evolve in the future and how it can be justified philosophically. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `Tonight, I am going to talk about the <span class="text-highlight">Earth’s ocean environment</span>. I want to <span class="text-highlight">surprise</span> and <span class="text-highlight">delight</span>you, to challenge you with some of the issues that are <span class="text-highlight">problematic</span> for <span class="text-highlight">oceans</span>, to look at some <span class="text-highlight">potential solutions</span>, and perhaps to <span class="text-highlight">provoke</span> you think about these issues in a more <span class="text-highlight">critical and connected way</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Environmental</span> <span class="text-highlight">scientists</span> are finding increasing <span class="text-highlight">evidence</span> of human-induced <span class="text-highlight">damage to oceans</span> at vast scale – destruction of fish and <span class="text-highlight">coral ecosystems</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">massive</span> gyrating pools of plastic refuse, for example.

    solution: `The lecturer talked about the Earth’s ocean environment, and issues that are problematic for oceans. She firstly introduced potential solutions to these problems and provoked listeners to think about these issues in a more critical way. Additionally, she provided some evidence including the destruction of coral ecosystems, and massive plastic refuse. Finally, she suggested to reduce the footprint of human activity and restore the damage to the largest living space. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "The discovery of the structure DNA – DNA 3",
    transcript: `The <span class="text-highlight">discovery</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">structure of DNA</span> but something that was really <span class="text-highlight">important</span>, allowing <span class="text-highlight">scientists</span> to start looking at and thinking about the <span class="text-highlight">effect</span> of <span class="text-highlight">genes</span>, and how they might affect <span class="text-highlight">behaviour</span>. Okay? So early on, we might just think the <span class="text-highlight">genes were responsible</span> for our <span class="text-highlight">physical structure</span>, our <span class="text-highlight">height</span>, our <span class="text-highlight">hair colour</span>, and so on, and not so much for our behaviour. But we now know that there's probably at least some degree of <span class="text-highlight">genetic responsibility</span> for all of our <span class="text-highlight">actual behaviours</span> are <span class="text-highlight">psychological</span> behaviours as well, not just physical behaviours, and the mapping of the <span class="text-highlight">human genome</span> that was completed in 2001. What is that? I won't even dare ask if anyone heard about that. That gave us a lot of <span class="text-highlight">interesting information</span>. And it's been allowing both the study of biology but also the study of psychology and <span class="text-highlight">neuroscience</span> to <span class="text-highlight">progress rapidly</span> and <span class="text-highlight">start integrating information</span> about what we know from genes and studying it.`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed the structure of DNA, which is really important in knowing the effect of genes. She firstly explained how DNA may affect behaviour and why genes are responsible for our physical structure. Additionally, she claimed that there is probably genetic responsibility for actual and psychological behaviours, plus the mapping of human genome. She finally concluded that DNA provides the study of biology, psychology and neuroscience with interesting information. _(70 words)_`,
