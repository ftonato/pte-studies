    topic: "Human rights",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">The human right acts</span> can be seen as far reaching as <span class="text-highlight">controversial in the UK history of rights</span>, at the same times it can be described as some more <span class="text-highlight">cautious document</span> that provide <span class="text-highlight">a starting point for wider application for law to rights</span>. In many ways the <span class="text-highlight">freedom protection</span> contains <span class="text-highlight">within the human rights act</span> were <span class="text-highlight">not new to people living in the UK</span>. The act presents to the UK law, most of the clauses the European conventional human rights. The convention itself was divides following the end of the Second World War by the council of beau. UK lawyers played <span class="text-highlight">a significant role in the drafting of the convention</span> and the UK was among the first governments to rectify the convention in 1951. Rights are sometimes described as being of a positive or a negative nature but to say some can be express as a right too and others are a freedom from. The 1988 act puts into place 15 specific crimes in freedoms which includes rights to limited security, a free trial, free expression, free elections and the right to marry into family to family. There are also <span class="text-highlight">freedoms from torture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">from slavery</span> or <span class="text-highlight">force labour</span> and <span class="text-highlight">from discrimination</span> grounds such as race, sex, religion, political opinion or social origin. The human right acts has been described as <span class="text-highlight">the start of a process</span>, the act itself does not expand on the provisions made by the European convention, which some of consider as holding <span class="text-highlight">a baseline or a minimum standard of the human rights</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the history of human rights, which can be described as a starting point for wider application in the UK. He also indicated that the freedom protection within the Human Right Act included freedoms from torture, from slavery and from discrimination. He emphasized that UK lawyers played a significant role in the drafting of the convention and the UK was the first governments to rectify it. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "London Architecture",
    transcript: `It seems to me that <span class="text-highlight">architecture</span> is very much something that <span class="text-highlight">causes it both pleasure and trouble</span>. I'm from a part of West London, where I feel that many of the streets where I live really, really ugly. And this distresses me every time I walk into a supermarket or walk to the tube and think, god why did they build that? And <span class="text-highlight">terrible problem with architecture</span> is that it <span class="text-highlight">last so long</span>, if you write a bad book or do a bad play, you know it’ll have a short run and then be shelved and no one will suffer, a <span class="text-highlight">bad building</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">serious impact</span> for, could be hundreds of years, <span class="text-highlight">on the people around it</span> and um especially the book a rose a little bit of frustration was anger. There was so many bad architecture around and then I realized when you talk to architectures and you say um why building not more beautiful, they’ll say ‘Ma, how you use such a word as beauty, that’s a really arrogant word. No one knows what beautiful, it’s all <span class="text-highlight">in the eyes of the beholder</span>.’ I couldn’t help but think that actually, well you know, we all tend to agree that in Rome is nicer than Milton Keynes and that San Francisco has the edge of Frankfurt Tyfull. You may ask for generalization, surely there are something’s we can say about <span class="text-highlight">why a building works and why it doesn’t</span>. So, the book is already in an attempted to suggest <span class="text-highlight">why architectures works</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it does</span> and <span class="text-highlight">what might be going wrong</span> <span class="text-highlight">when it doesn’t work</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the concept of architecture that causes both pleasure and trouble. He firstly indicated that a poorly designed building has serious impacts on the people around it. He strongly agreed that there was so much bad architecture and emphasized terrible problems with architecture as it lasts longer than a bad book or a bad play. He finally introduced a book to suggest why and how architecture works. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Big Bang",
    transcript: `One of the <span class="text-highlight">most amazing things that’s happened</span> even in my lifetime is the <span class="text-highlight">prediction of cosmology</span>. When I started out forty odd years ago, we thought we knew that <span class="text-highlight">the universe began a big bang</span> , some people doubted even then. We thought <span class="text-highlight">the universe</span> was about ten or twenty billion years old but now for really very sound <span class="text-highlight">scientific reasons</span> we can say that the universe did started in a Big bang and it’s 13.8 billion years old so it’s not 14, its not 13 because <span class="text-highlight">a decimal point in there</span> and that’s a <span class="text-highlight">stunning achievement</span> to know that. And we also know that the <span class="text-highlight">laws of physical</span> that apply to <span class="text-highlight">tiny particles inside atoms</span> also <span class="text-highlight">explains what happened in the big bang</span> you can’t have one without the other. A very neat example of this is that when you apply <span class="text-highlight">nuclear physics</span>, that kind of physics to understand <span class="text-highlight">how stars work</span>, you find out that the oldest star in the universe is about 13 billion years old. So their universe is just a little bit older than the stars. Fantastic, if we done it and counted in the other way around and said that the stars were older than the universe, we would say <span class="text-highlight">science</span> were in deep trouble. But it’s not, everything fits together and we know <span class="text-highlight">how the universe began</span>, we got to know how the way it is. The future that it ‘ll suspects we don’t know quiet well what’s going, but we got some ideas, which are as good as those ideas we had 40 years ago about <span class="text-highlight">how big bang happened</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the prediction of cosmology which is one of the most amazing things that happened in his lifetime. He firstly had a discussion about a stunning achievement to know that the Universe did start in a Big Bang and it is 13.8 billion years old. In addition, he emphasized the laws of physics explaining what happened in the Big Bang helped scientists know exactly how the universe began. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Danger of keeping drugs at home",
    transcript: `“But what are the <span class="text-highlight">dangers of keeping these drugs</span> at home?”<br/><br/>
    “There are a number of dangers. Parents should know that <span class="text-highlight">leftover drugs are dangerous</span> because they may be <span class="text-highlight">accidentally ingested by children</span>. Either adults don’t keep the bottles properly closed and stored or because even many kids can sometimes open childproof lids. <span class="text-highlight">Patients may use the drugs after their expiration date</span>. The leftover drugs may be <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong reasons</span>. For example, someone may have a <span class="text-highlight">viral infection</span> and <span class="text-highlight">self-prescribed</span> to left over into microbial that was prescribed for a bacterial infection. But that drug will have no effect as the viral infections. Drugs that are left over might be given to or taken by someone else who may have a <span class="text-highlight">serious allergy</span> to the medicine and who for that reason would not be prescribed to medicine under the supervision of a physician. Finally, <span class="text-highlight">inappropriate use of drugs promotes drug resistance</span> if the drug is <span class="text-highlight">taken for the wrong indication, the wrong duration, or in the wrong dosage</span>.<br/><br/>
    “Todd, what can people do about this how can the situation be improved?”<br/><br/>
    “I think <span class="text-highlight">physicians, patients and parents of patients</span> can take steps to <span class="text-highlight">improve the situation</span>. First of all, physicians should <span class="text-highlight">prescribe the drug only when appropriate</span>, only in the <span class="text-highlight">correct amount</span> and only for the <span class="text-highlight">correct duration</span>. Also, the physician must <span class="text-highlight">stress to the patient</span> that the <span class="text-highlight">full course of the drug must be taken</span>. This is recommended <span class="text-highlight">even if symptoms resolved before the end of the prescription</span> and parents of children on antibiotics need to ensure they complete their course as well.”`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the dangers of keeping drugs. He indicated that leftover drugs are dangerous because they may be accidentally taken by children. In addition, patients may use their drugs after their expiration date and the leftover drugs may be taken for the wrong decision. Finally, he strongly recommended that both patients and their parents can take important steps to improve the situation of the inappropriate use of drugs. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Talent war version 2",
    transcript: `The time in late ninety-nineties when <span class="text-highlight">management consultants</span> wrote books with titles such as ‘<span class="text-highlight">The war for talent</span>’, there was a great deal of talk about the <span class="text-highlight">talent wars</span>. Then I think there was the <span class="text-highlight">bursting of the bubble</span> with the bursting of the dark karma book and a sense of the people who had been <span class="text-highlight">masters of the universe</span> just a few weeks before were out on the streets looking for jobs. I think this created a <span class="text-highlight">reaction</span>, it gave me ideas of that <span class="text-highlight">there was a war for talent</span>, in fact all of the things were saw in late ninety-nineties are <span class="text-highlight">reasserting</span> themselves now, all those shortages are reasserting themselves and the real reason the audit was really the bursting of the bubble not the <span class="text-highlight">shortages of talent</span>. There are very <span class="text-highlight">profound structural forces</span>, which are created these talent shortages. One is the fact that <span class="text-highlight">the</span>nature of the economy<span class="text-highlight">is changing</span>; it’s putting more and <span class="text-highlight">more premium upon intellectual skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">analytical skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">creative skills</span>, which <span class="text-highlight">are in short supply</span> so there is a demand increase but there is also a <span class="text-highlight">decrease incline</span>. Because we’re seeing now the <span class="text-highlight">age of baby pool</span> the <span class="text-highlight">shirking of population</span> in Europe, Japan and not very long in China as well and the sort of stabilization that the population of the United States. So we see a time when there is a greater demand for <span class="text-highlight">intellectual skills</span> and slowing down in the supple of people who possess those skills and also a <span class="text-highlight">mismatch between the sort of things that people are learning at school</span>, when university and the sort of things the economy is placing a premium on, particularly with the <span class="text-highlight">shortage of trained people in the sciences and engineering</span> so for all sort of reasons there’s a <span class="text-highlight">premium on talent</span>.`,

The other purpose of Stanford University is to promote learning; <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of school education is to promote learning about education</span>, <span class="text-highlight">the purpose of the business school is to promote learning about management</span>. Most of the world’s businesses services are delivered by <span class="text-highlight">managed instincts institutions</span>, that are <span class="text-highlight">for-profit managed institutions, not-for-profit managed institutions</span>. We rely on the managed institutions that’s our <span class="text-highlight">chosen instrument society</span> to get things done and implement services, particularly educational services which is done by people on their own. The quality of which is done, the performance that underlies how that ever takes place is perfect and we think that in a school of business, the school management has a lot to do with management. The people who <span class="text-highlight">take responsibility</span> for the results, a tremendous sense of worship were saying that they get accomplished and that the work that must be done through other people is in fact done and that there is a capability also by the mangers and people that they feel responsible for.`,

    topic: "Australian Housing",
    transcript: `Well it's like, <span class="text-highlight">why is Australian housing so expensive</span>? Essentially it's a showing of <span class="text-highlight">how well the Australian economy has been doing over the last 15 years</span>. We have had 15 years, more or less of uninterrupted and economic growth during which <span class="text-highlight">average earnings</span> have risen by close to &nbsp;90%. While over the course of that period the <span class="text-highlight">standard variable mortgage rate has roughly halved</span>. That meant that the amount which a typical home buying household can afford to borrow under rules which aren’t strictly applied as which they used to be, have more than doubled. Over the same period <span class="text-highlight">rising immigration</span> and <span class="text-highlight">falling average household size</span> have meant that the <span class="text-highlight">number households looking for accommodation has risen</span> by about <span class="text-highlight">one and a half million</span>, that's around 200 thousand more than the number of dwellings has increased by. So you have had a <span class="text-highlight">substantial increase</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">purchasing power of households</span>, no net increase in the supply of housing and hence all that addition purchasing power has gone into <span class="text-highlight">pushing up the price of housing</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the main reason why Australian housing is expensive. She firstly introduced many concepts including economic growth, average earnings, mortgage rate, immigration issues, and home buying households who afford to borrow money. Additionally, she explained that the number of households looking for accommodations has significantly increased over the period of time. Finally, she concluded that purchasing power is the main factor pushing up the price of housing.  _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Language Death",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Language death is not a mainstream theatre</span>. It is not mainstream anything. Can you imagine Hollywood taking it on? It is so far <span class="text-highlight">outside the mindsets of most people</span> that they have a difficulty appreciating what the crisis is all about because they are not used to thinking more about language as an issue in itself. Somehow, we need to change these mindsets. We need to <span class="text-highlight">get people thinking more about language more explicitly</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more intimately</span>, <span class="text-highlight">more enthusiastically</span>. Interest in language is certainly there, in the general population. Most people <span class="text-highlight">are fascinated by such topics</span> as <span class="text-highlight">where words come from</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">what the origin of their town’s name is</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">whether their baby’s name means anything</span>; they are certainly prepared to play Scrabble and a host of other language games and infinitum; and you get language games on radio and television too – but a <span class="text-highlight">willingness</span> to focus that interest on general issues, a <span class="text-highlight">preparedness to take on board the emotion</span> and <span class="text-highlight">drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment</span>, <span class="text-highlight">is not something that happens much</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about language death which is not a mainstream theatre. In addition, he emphasized the importance of changing humans’ mindsets about languages. He suggested that people should think about language more explicitly, more intimately and more enthusiastically. Although people are interested in many language topics, they lack a willingness to focus and a preparedness to take on board the drama inherent in the situation of language endangerment. _(69 words)_`,

    topic: "Universe (or Einstein)",
    transcript: `For thousands of years, <span class="text-highlight">philosophers and astronomers</span> think of all sorts and imagine of <span class="text-highlight">the universe</span>, <span class="text-highlight">this space around us</span>. It's <span class="text-highlight">rather like a constant</span>. It was <span class="text-highlight">fixed and unchangeable</span>, and things happened in it. Just as <span class="text-highlight">people walk around</span>, so <span class="text-highlight">stars</span>, the <span class="text-highlight">comets</span>, the planets, and the other heavenly bodies<span class="text-highlight">moved around and trace down their parts on this completely</span>unchanging status space<span class="text-highlight">. In the 21st century, as</span>the result of Einstein's work<span class="text-highlight">that</span>fixed and unchangeable<span class="text-highlight">universe</span>was completely transformer<span class="text-highlight">. We began to understand that the universe is</span>absolutely not fixed<span class="text-highlight">state stage of space at all on which also listed emotions played out.

And the real <span class="text-highlight">important</span> word there is if because it turns out that  in  <span class="text-highlight">climates</span> which aren't  <span class="text-highlight">near</span> the <span class="text-highlight">equator</span>, there’s a <span class="text-highlight">big</span>   <span class="text-highlight">question</span> as to whether human beings get  <span class="text-highlight">enough</span>  sunshine. That's important because <span class="text-highlight">fruits</span> are not<span class="text-highlight">naturally</span> <span class="text-highlight">abundant</span> in <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span>, and that's why <span class="text-highlight">milk</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">fortified</span>. But the <span class="text-highlight">fortification</span> may not be <span class="text-highlight">enough</span>. So again, if  <span class="text-highlight">exposure</span> to  <span class="text-highlight">sunlight</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">adequate</span> ,  <span class="text-highlight">no need</span> for  <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span> . So vitamin D really isn't a vitamin, it's a  <span class="text-highlight">pro-hormone</span> . When <span class="text-highlight">human beings</span> <span class="text-highlight">evolve</span>, we evolve in <span class="text-highlight">tropical climates</span> and run around naked, there was plenty of <span class="text-highlight">skin exposure</span>  to  <span class="text-highlight">sunlight</span>, and so there was  <span class="text-highlight">no dietary need</span>  for vitamin D. As humans <span class="text-highlight">migrated</span>  away from <span class="text-highlight">equatorial regions</span>, they actually created a <span class="text-highlight">need</span> for <span class="text-highlight">vitamin D</span>  in  <span class="text-highlight">food</span> because sunlight was <span class="text-highlight">inadequate</span>, particularly during the <span class="text-highlight">winter</span> and especially if you have to  <span class="text-highlight">wear clothes</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about vitamin D, which is called the sunshine vitamin. Vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a pro-hormone which is necessary in food for people who do not get adequate sunshine. In addition, people migrating away from equatorial regions need this type of vitamin. However, foods are not always naturally abundant in vitamin D and people do not need it if their exposure to sunlight is adequate. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Analysing Questionnaires",
    transcript: `Questions can be divided into <span class="text-highlight">three types</span>. This is sometimes called level of <span class="text-highlight">measurement</span>. Firstly, we have <span class="text-highlight">category</span>  <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span>, which are also known as <span class="text-highlight">nominal</span> <span class="text-highlight">questions</span>. These are when <span class="text-highlight">participants</span>  <span class="text-highlight">select</span>  from a list of <span class="text-highlight">categories</span> for their  <span class="text-highlight">response</span> , such as <span class="text-highlight">male</span> or <span class="text-highlight">female</span>, or they may include <span class="text-highlight">ethnic origin</span>. Secondly, we have <span class="text-highlight">ordinal</span>  <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span>. These are <span class="text-highlight">similar</span> to category questions. But instead of the categories being <span class="text-highlight">independent</span>, there is some sort of <span class="text-highlight">order</span> between them. If we ask people to  <span class="text-highlight">indicate</span>  their  <span class="text-highlight">age</span> in categories, this is an  <span class="text-highlight">ordinal</span>   <span class="text-highlight">type questions</span> . Thirdly, we have <span class="text-highlight">continuous</span>  <span class="text-highlight">questions</span>. These are any question that can be  <span class="text-highlight">answered</span>  by a  <span class="text-highlight">number</span> . It could be an <span class="text-highlight">open-ended</span>   <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, asking participants to tell you how many  <span class="text-highlight">times</span>  they  <span class="text-highlight">attended lectures</span> , or how often they  <span class="text-highlight">use</span>  the  <span class="text-highlight">valley</span> .Or it could involve asking them to write the <span class="text-highlight">importance</span> or <span class="text-highlight">intensity</span> of some <span class="text-highlight">experience</span>. The reasons are to remind you the type of questions is our <span class="text-highlight">choice</span> of <span class="text-highlight">question</span>, this type of tough <span class="text-highlight">analysis</span> we can use. Therefore, it’s <span class="text-highlight">important</span> to get our <span class="text-highlight">questionnaires</span>  <span class="text-highlight">correct</span> in the first place.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about three main types of questionnaires and introduced some terms to use when analysing responses. He firstly mentioned the category type questions, which are called nominal questions.

    topic: "Why Read Plato’s book? (The Republic)",
    transcript: `Why should we <span class="text-highlight">read</span> the <span class="text-highlight">Republic</span>? There might be lots of students asked this question to themselves given a set book at the beginning of their university course. But in fact there are many good  <span class="text-highlight">reasons</span> to read the Republic and the first one I would pick on is just that it is  <span class="text-highlight">immensely</span>  <span class="text-highlight">readable</span>. It's not <span class="text-highlight">Plato</span>  did not write <span class="text-highlight">philosophy</span> like a <span class="text-highlight">dry text book</span>. He wrote it like a <span class="text-highlight">living conversation.</span> The whole of the Republic, which is a fairly fat  <span class="text-highlight">book</span>  is a living conversation written in short almost sound bite  <span class="text-highlight">type answers</span> , but nevertheless <span class="text-highlight">developing</span> some very, very <span class="text-highlight">important ideas</span>. So my first answer, then we should read the republic just because it is readable. It was <span class="text-highlight">written</span> by a <span class="text-highlight">genius</span> and it's <span class="text-highlight">worth reading</span>. It's <span class="text-highlight">easy</span> to <span class="text-highlight">read</span>, it's <span class="text-highlight">not difficult.</span> But then there's also obviously the the thoughts, the  <span class="text-highlight">content</span> of the book, and he's asking this absolutely <span class="text-highlight">fundamental question</span>, why should we bother to be good? What's in it for us effectively? It seems when we look at the world that looks as though injustice pays, it looks as though crime pays, or as the good people get trodden down, so Plato <span class="text-highlight">addresses</span> this absolutely <span class="text-highlight">fundamental question</span>. Why should we be good? I'm not going to tell you his answer, read the book. And then there's, he gives. It's a <span class="text-highlight">thought-provoking book</span>. So first of all, what I'm trying to say is it's <span class="text-highlight">accessible</span> to anybody to read, and it will provoke people to think. He asks the question, <span class="text-highlight">what is</span><span class="text-highlight">justice</span>? He gives an <span class="text-highlight">astonishing answer</span>  and answer this bound to make anybody think because it doesn't frame the answer in terms that we would expect, like  <span class="text-highlight">justice</span>  is to do with <span class="text-highlight">equity</span> or how you <span class="text-highlight">deal with</span> other <span class="text-highlight">people</span>, your  <span class="text-highlight">friends</span> your  <span class="text-highlight">family</span> , the  <span class="text-highlight">world</span>   <span class="text-highlight">around you</span> . He frames an answer in terms of how you should <span class="text-highlight">structure</span> the <span class="text-highlight">different parts</span> of your  <span class="text-highlight">mind</span> as an <span class="text-highlight">individual,</span> so that you can become adjust person within yourself and then act out that <span class="text-highlight">justice</span> in the outside world. So you know, that's a <span class="text-highlight">typical</span>, <span class="text-highlight">thought-provoking</span> <span class="text-highlight">answer</span> that he gives to a  <span class="text-highlight">fundamental</span>  <span class="text-highlight">question</span> . This is why we should read the Republic.`,

But there was that <span class="text-highlight">dream tucked away</span> inside of me to do this.

Finally, in the  <span class="text-highlight">early 90s</span> , I <span class="text-highlight">took</span>  my <span class="text-highlight">deep breath</span>  and started <span class="text-highlight">writing fiction</span>.

In <span class="text-highlight">fashion terms</span>, they are classed as ‘<span class="text-highlight">accessories</span>’ along with shoes, jewelry, handbags or watches. But in <span class="text-highlight">healthcare terms</span>, they are of course a <span class="text-highlight">medical device</span>.

    topic: "Light Bulbs or Energy Consumption",
    transcript: `This is a 40-watt <span class="text-highlight">light bulb</span>. If you leave it on all the time, it uses one kilowatt-hour every day. And it's possible to express all forms of <span class="text-highlight">power consumption</span> using  this unit of the light bulb. I started <span class="text-highlight">measuring</span> everything around my <span class="text-highlight">house</span>, around my <span class="text-highlight">office</span>. And I found some surprising things. First, a plug of a <span class="text-highlight">phone charger</span>. And it didn't even register on this power meter. It uses one hundredth of a light bulb of power. So I don’t think the <span class="text-highlight">phone charger</span> is gonna be our <span class="text-highlight">number one form</span> of <span class="text-highlight">energy consumption</span>. Just taking one  <span class="text-highlight">hot bath</span>  every day uses the  <span class="text-highlight">same energy</span> , <span class="text-highlight">same power</span> of five light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. And I found I've been steadily using 40 light bulbs worth of <span class="text-highlight">gas for heating</span>, making <span class="text-highlight">hot air</span> or <span class="text-highlight">hot water</span>. And that surprised me. <span class="text-highlight">Transport</span>  is  <span class="text-highlight">one</span>  of the  <span class="text-highlight">biggest forms</span> of energy consumption, and it uses about a <span class="text-highlight">third</span> of our <span class="text-highlight">energy</span>. If you drive an average car 50 kilometers a day, that car forms too having 40 light bulbs on all the time. Today, the average <span class="text-highlight">British person</span>  is using 125 light bulbs of power. That’s 125 light bulbs on all the time, nonstop. That’s <span class="text-highlight">huge</span>.`,
    solution: `The talk delineated a detailed picture regarding forms of energy consumption. The lecturer firstly provided many examples of power consumption by using the unit of the light bulb to measure everything around his house. In addition, he found that transport is one of the biggest forms of energy consumption. Finally, the aforementioned discussion emphasized the fact that British people are using a huge amount of power in their daily lives. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Fossil Fuels",
    transcript: `This is talk about <span class="text-highlight">visualizing life</span> without <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span>. We have an addiction to fossil fuels and it's not <span class="text-highlight">sustainable</span> when I say we. I'm talking about the so-called <span class="text-highlight">developed world</span>, the developed world gets 80 or 90% of all its <span class="text-highlight">energy</span> from <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> and living on fossil fuels for energy. In this way, it's  <span class="text-highlight">not sustainable</span>  for <span class="text-highlight">three</span> fairly obvious <span class="text-highlight">reasons</span>. First, on the left easily <span class="text-highlight">accessible</span> fossil fuels are a <span class="text-highlight">finite</span> <span class="text-highlight">resource</span> and so some point that <span class="text-highlight">resource</span> will be <span class="text-highlight">exploited</span> and humanity will have to do something else. Second, <span class="text-highlight">setting fire</span> to fossil fuels <span class="text-highlight">puts</span> <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide</span>  <span class="text-highlight">upstairs</span>. So, we have <span class="text-highlight">climate motivation</span>. The clear <span class="text-highlight">consensus</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">climate science</span>  <span class="text-highlight">community</span> is with substantial aero bars still on exactly what might happen. Their <span class="text-highlight">advice</span>  is this is a  <span class="text-highlight">geoengineering</span> <span class="text-highlight">experiment</span>that was well advised to <span class="text-highlight">stop</span>  <span class="text-highlight">as soon as possible</span>. And third, even if you don't believe in <span class="text-highlight">climate change</span> and even if global fossil fuels aren't running out today, it might be the case that your fossil fuels or our  <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> in a particular country or state have <span class="text-highlight">run out</span> and you might <span class="text-highlight">depend on</span> other <span class="text-highlight">countries</span> or  <span class="text-highlight">states</span> for fossil fuels in the <span class="text-highlight">future</span>. So, you have a security of  <span class="text-highlight">supply motivation</span> for saying let's <span class="text-highlight">look into</span>  really  <span class="text-highlight">getting off</span>  <span class="text-highlight">fossil fuels</span> in a  <span class="text-highlight">serious way</span>. I find  all three of these  <span class="text-highlight">motivations</span> are  <span class="text-highlight">equally</span> <span class="text-highlight">compelling</span> and I'm just going to take it as given now that we are interested in <span class="text-highlight">discussing</span> <span class="text-highlight">life</span> <span class="text-highlight">after fossil fuels</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about fossil fuels which are unsustainable in developed countries. He firstly indicated that accessible fossil fuels are finite and burning fossil fuels may lead to a significant increase in the amount of carbon dioxide. Moreover, he emphasized that a country may need to depend on other nations for fossil fuels in the future. Hence, the aforementioned discussion highlighted the significance of three motivations which are equally compelling. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Kids in the museum",
    transcript: `So, just over  <span class="text-highlight">ten years ago</span> , when I was in the Royal Academy, a  <span class="text-highlight">museum</span> in the centre of <span class="text-highlight">London</span>, with my <span class="text-highlight">three children</span>, at the Aztec <span class="text-highlight">exhibition</span>. I don’t know if any of you saw it. I had an <span class="text-highlight">older child</span> and two <span class="text-highlight">younger children</span>, <span class="text-highlight">twins</span>, strapped in a pushchair, and <span class="text-highlight">one</span>  of my  <span class="text-highlight">children</span>, three years old, <span class="text-highlight">shouted</span> and I’ve never denied he shouted  he shouted, ‘Monster,  monster!’  at this  <span class="text-highlight">statue</span> which looked just <span class="text-highlight">like a monster</span>, had <span class="text-highlight">snakes</span> for hair, a big beak for a nose. And, I thought, this is fantastic – I’ve got a three-year old that’s <span class="text-highlight">appreciating</span>  <span class="text-highlight">pre-Hispanic</span>  <span class="text-highlight">art</span> – how good can it get? <br/><br/> So, I bent down and I said, ‘Yes, it looks just like a monster’. And, at that moment, a room warden came over, a <span class="text-highlight">gallery assistant</span> came over and said we were being too <span class="text-highlight">noisy,</span> and <span class="text-highlight">threw us out</span>. Wrong family. I was, at that time, <span class="text-highlight">a journalist</span> with The <span class="text-highlight">Guardian</span>  <span class="text-highlight">newspaper</span>, and two days later <span class="text-highlight">wrote</span> a big piece in The Guardian about being  <span class="text-highlight">thrown out</span>  of the Royal Academy. What was really interesting was, by the end of that day, we had had, at the paper, over <span class="text-highlight">500 emails</span>  from other <span class="text-highlight">families</span> saying, ‘Museums aren’t working for us. Let’s try and make it work’. So, that’s what we did. In The Guardian, we <span class="text-highlight">set up</span>  a  <span class="text-highlight">campaign</span>. We called it <span class="text-highlight">the Kids in Museums</span>  <span class="text-highlight">campaign</span>, but it didn’t really exist. It was just a  <span class="text-highlight">few pages</span> . We ran  <span class="text-highlight">loads</span>  of  <span class="text-highlight">stories</span>  on it; I began touring the country talking about how to  <span class="text-highlight">make</span>  your  <span class="text-highlight">museum</span>  family  <span class="text-highlight">friendly</span>; I was a journalist. I was called in to see the then <span class="text-highlight">director</span> of the National Gallery in London, and I’ll <span class="text-highlight">never forget</span> this<span class="text-highlight">moment</span>, when he called me in and said, ‘We really like this Kids in Museums campaign, and we’ve been talking on our board about it, and we have  <span class="text-highlight">some ideas</span> of how we might  <span class="text-highlight">work together</span> , and I’d like you to take them back to your team.`,
    solution: `The talk delineated a detailed picture regarding a campaign named the Kids in Museums. She firstly raised current issues of the museum by introducing her experience of being thrown out of the Royal Academy. She also emphasized the importance of making museums friendlier to families.

    topic: "Animal behaviour (or Are We Animals)",
    transcript: `<p>Far too many people often say things like <span class="text-highlight">animals</span> do this but we don’t. Or this animal does this and that animal does this, but the <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> don't do things like that. Those <span class="text-highlight">statements</span> have some <span class="text-highlight">hidden</span>  <span class="text-highlight">assumption</span> that we are  <span class="text-highlight">not animals</span>. When we say animals do this, animals do that, we often <span class="text-highlight">assume</span> that we are not animals. If we are not animals, what are we? Are we <span class="text-highlight">plants</span>or <span class="text-highlight">trees</span> or <span class="text-highlight">flowers</span>? No, we are not. Then okay, we are not plants. Are we <span class="text-highlight">microorganisms</span>, really  <span class="text-highlight">tiny</span>  <span class="text-highlight">microscopic</span>  things? No, we are not. Then the natural <span class="text-highlight">conclusion</span> must be we are not <span class="text-highlight">living things</span>. That's not true.Yes, we are animals and I <span class="text-highlight">see animals</span>  in us and I see <span class="text-highlight">humans</span>  in  <span class="text-highlight">animals</span>. So I'm going to talk about <span class="text-highlight">animal behavior</span> and human nature in order to  <span class="text-highlight">understand</span>   <span class="text-highlight">human nature</span>.

    topic: "Translator and Interpreter",
    transcript: `Hello, it's Megan. This week I'm going to talk about the <span class="text-highlight">difference</span>between <span class="text-highlight">translators</span> and <span class="text-highlight">interpreters</span>. It’s a <span class="text-highlight">common</span> <span class="text-highlight">misconception</span> that translators and interpreters <span class="text-highlight">do</span> the <span class="text-highlight">same</span>  <span class="text-highlight">thing</span>. So, I just like to highlight a few <span class="text-highlight">similarities</span> and <span class="text-highlight">differences</span> between the two. Firstly, translation refers to <span class="text-highlight">written communication</span> whereas interpreting refers to <span class="text-highlight">verbal communication</span>. So, for example, a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved. But would translate the written evidence used in the case. Secondly, both jobs <span class="text-highlight">require</span>  <span class="text-highlight">different skills</span>. I <span class="text-highlight">translate</span> to require the ability to <span class="text-highlight">write well</span> and <span class="text-highlight">comprehensively</span> into a <span class="text-highlight">target language</span>. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their <span class="text-highlight">native language</span>. For example, although I can <span class="text-highlight">speak French</span> to a <span class="text-highlight">good standard</span>. I cannot <span class="text-highlight">translate</span>  from <span class="text-highlight">English</span> to <span class="text-highlight">French</span> although I could translate from French to English, which means I’m only half way there to being an international player. An <span class="text-highlight">interpreter</span> needs to be able to <span class="text-highlight">speak</span> both <span class="text-highlight">languages</span>  <span class="text-highlight">proficiently</span>. Thirdly, the <span class="text-highlight">qualifications</span> and  <span class="text-highlight">experience</span> <span class="text-highlight">required</span> to become either a <span class="text-highlight">professional translator</span> or <span class="text-highlight">interpreter</span> do differ. Both roles  <span class="text-highlight">acquire</span> <span class="text-highlight">years</span>  of  <span class="text-highlight">training</span>, the resulting  <span class="text-highlight">qualification</span>. But what they can learn from the training Will be <span class="text-highlight">completely different</span>. So just to be clear <span class="text-highlight">translators</span> will <span class="text-highlight">translate</span> <span class="text-highlight">written texts</span> and <span class="text-highlight">interpreters</span> will translate a <span class="text-highlight">verbal communication</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the difference between translators and interpreters. She firstly introduced a common misconception that translators and interpreters do the same thing. In addition, she highlighted a few similarities and differences between the two by explaining that translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. In conclusion, she emphasized that the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. _(70 words)_`,

And according to a  <span class="text-highlight">study</span> from a <span class="text-highlight">British</span>   <span class="text-highlight">research</span> team published in the journal Nature, some like it hot. <span class="text-highlight">Bees</span> <span class="text-highlight">use up</span>  a lot of  <span class="text-highlight">energy</span> just <span class="text-highlight">stay</span> in <span class="text-highlight">warm</span> on some days. In fact, they <span class="text-highlight">can't</span> even <span class="text-highlight">fly</span> if they are <span class="text-highlight">too cold</span>. So, if one <span class="text-highlight">flower</span> is <span class="text-highlight">warmer</span> than another, a bee can  <span class="text-highlight">save</span> some of its <span class="text-highlight">fuel</span>  by  <span class="text-highlight">basking</span> on that flower while it's doing its <span class="text-highlight">pollinating</span> business. And it turns out that bumble bees  <span class="text-highlight">consistently</span> do <span class="text-highlight">choose</span>  <span class="text-highlight">warmer flowers</span> over  <span class="text-highlight">cooler</span> ones even when the two  <span class="text-highlight">flowers</span> <span class="text-highlight">offer</span>  up the <span class="text-highlight">same quantity</span> and quality of <span class="text-highlight">nectar</span>. Some plants seem to be <span class="text-highlight">evolutionarily</span> <span class="text-highlight">adapted</span> to be slightly <span class="text-highlight">warmer</span> because the warmer ones get  <span class="text-highlight">visited</span> more by the <span class="text-highlight">chilly</span>  <span class="text-highlight">bees</span>. When it comes to getting <span class="text-highlight">pollinated,</span> apparently the <span class="text-highlight">heat</span> is on. And that is the buzz.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the reason why the bumble bees pick some flowers over others. She firstly introduced that bees use color to recognize a flower's temperature. In addition, bees cannot fly if they are too cold or when they use up a lot of energy. Finally, bumble bees consistently choose warmer flowers over cooler ones even when the two flowers offer up the same quantity and quality of nectar. _(70 words)_`,

It is <span class="text-highlight">called</span> <span class="text-highlight">the Krebs cycle</span>, which some of you may remember from your  <span class="text-highlight">chemistry course</span> in your high school. Krebs is a<span class="text-highlight">wonderful</span> <span class="text-highlight">example</span> to me of how a  <span class="text-highlight">scientist</span> who is  <span class="text-highlight">determined</span> can <span class="text-highlight">overcome</span>  all kinds of <span class="text-highlight">human</span> <span class="text-highlight">obstacles</span>.

    topic: "Children Literature",
    transcript: `I'm a professor of <span class="text-highlight">children</span> 's  <span class="text-highlight">literature</span> at Newcastle University. And I wanted to write a very <span class="text-highlight">short</span>  <span class="text-highlight">introduction</span> to children's literature. Because although here in <span class="text-highlight">Britain</span>, we have one of the  <span class="text-highlight">longest</span> and <span class="text-highlight">most</span>  <span class="text-highlight">distinguished</span> <span class="text-highlight">traditions</span> of <span class="text-highlight">creating</span> <span class="text-highlight">books</span> for children, perhaps the longest and most distinguished in the world, we often take them for granted. And we don't  <span class="text-highlight">pay</span> enough <span class="text-highlight">attention</span>  <span class="text-highlight">to what a</span> remarkable <span class="text-highlight">cultural resource</span> they are for adults and the kind of  <span class="text-highlight">cultural work</span> they do for children and the way that they've served writers and illustrators as a <span class="text-highlight">cultural space</span> for <span class="text-highlight">creativity</span>, <span class="text-highlight">subversion</span> and <span class="text-highlight">opportunities</span> to <span class="text-highlight">experiment</span> with <span class="text-highlight">new ideas</span>. So what kind of <span class="text-highlight">cultural work</span> that children's books do  <span class="text-highlight">look at</span> the level of an <span class="text-highlight">individual child</span>. This is one of the places where children<span class="text-highlight">learn</span> the <span class="text-highlight">vocabularies</span>, get the <span class="text-highlight">vicarious</span> <span class="text-highlight">experiences</span> and see the <span class="text-highlight">images</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">world</span> that help them think about, about how the world works and where they fit into it. Because children's books are one of the <span class="text-highlight">first places</span> that <span class="text-highlight">children</span> <span class="text-highlight">encounter</span> these things. They're often very direct as a <span class="text-highlight">source</span> of <span class="text-highlight">information</span> about what a <span class="text-highlight">particular period</span> <span class="text-highlight">thinks</span>, including what it <span class="text-highlight">thinks</span> a <span class="text-highlight">child is</span>, what a child <span class="text-highlight">needs to know</span>, what <span class="text-highlight">childhood</span> <span class="text-highlight">looks like</span>. Sometimes when we're <span class="text-highlight">looking at</span> children's books from the <span class="text-highlight">past</span>, it's very <span class="text-highlight">important</span> to <span class="text-highlight">notice</span> the kinds of children who aren’t there, for instance. So that's one of the things that we have in children's books.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about children’s literature which is usually underestimated. She firstly indicated writers and illustrators have a cultural space for creativity, separation and opportunities to experiment with new concepts. In addition, children’s books can help them to learn the vocabularies, get the vicarious experiences and see how the world works. Finally, she emphasized that children’s books are important sources of information to let them know what childhood looks like. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `Well, the <span class="text-highlight">Voynich</span> <span class="text-highlight">manuscript</span> does have many <span class="text-highlight">different</span>  <span class="text-highlight">theories</span>  <span class="text-highlight">proposed</span>for it. Some people think that it’s a  <span class="text-highlight">complete</span>  <span class="text-highlight">hoax</span> . It’s now been carbon <span class="text-highlight">dated</span> from the <span class="text-highlight">15th century</span>. So it's most likely if it is a hope that’s been a 15th-century hoax, which I personally don’t believe. But some people think it's just  <span class="text-highlight">gobbledygook</span> . It's just an <span class="text-highlight">invention</span> to <span class="text-highlight">make money</span>. Somebody made it to <span class="text-highlight">fool people</span> and <span class="text-highlight">make money</span>. Other people think it's probably a  <span class="text-highlight">code</span>. In other words, someone <span class="text-highlight">encoded</span> lots of <span class="text-highlight">secrets</span> in it, hoping that no one would find out. And if so, that's been very successful because <span class="text-highlight">no one</span> has <span class="text-highlight">corrected</span> it so far. But in my opinion, it is actually a<span class="text-highlight">genuine script</span>. Obviously, a <span class="text-highlight">human</span> <span class="text-highlight">devised</span> <span class="text-highlight">script</span> but <span class="text-highlight">masking</span> behind it a <span class="text-highlight">genuine</span> <span class="text-highlight">human language</span>. In a language, it seems to me to have more if you like Near Eastern, maybe Caucasian, Asian aspects, to it rather than European because of some of the <span class="text-highlight">words</span> that I’ve <span class="text-highlight">decoded</span>. So I would imagine that once we’ve actually <span class="text-highlight">managed</span> to <span class="text-highlight">decode</span> the <span class="text-highlight">script</span>, we'll find that the <span class="text-highlight">language</span> underneath is a <span class="text-highlight">natural</span> human language probably from that part of the world.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the Voynich manuscript with many different theories proposed for it. He firstly had a discussion on the invention of Voynich manuscript to make money or fool people. In addition, some people tried to encode many secrets, but no one could find out how to correct a genuine script. Finally, he predicted that if people can decode the script, they may find it a natural human language. _(70 words)_`,

And it's no wonder studies show the <span class="text-highlight">commercial work</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Consumers</span> go to their <span class="text-highlight">doctors</span> with a suggestion for a <span class="text-highlight">prescription drug</span> they saw <span class="text-highlight">advertised</span> on TV. Now a study in the annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message these ads promote in peers Patty Nieman reports. You are most likely to see <span class="text-highlight">drug ads</span> during <span class="text-highlight">prime time</span>, especially around the <span class="text-highlight">news</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Researchers</span>  <span class="text-highlight">analyzed</span> <span class="text-highlight">38 ads</span> aimed at people with <span class="text-highlight">conditions</span> like <span class="text-highlight">hypertension</span>, <span class="text-highlight">herpes</span>, <span class="text-highlight">high cholesterol</span>, <span class="text-highlight">depression</span>, <span class="text-highlight">arthritis</span> and <span class="text-highlight">allergies</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">drug industry</span> says these ads arm consumers with information, but researchers found that though  the <span class="text-highlight">information</span> was technically <span class="text-highlight">accurate</span>, the <span class="text-highlight">tone</span> was <span class="text-highlight">misleading</span>. UCLA  <span class="text-highlight">psychologist</span>  Dominic Frosh headed the  <span class="text-highlight">study</span> . “What we would  <span class="text-highlight">see</span>  in these  <span class="text-highlight">ads</span>  is that before taking the prescription drug, the <span class="text-highlight">character</span> 's  <span class="text-highlight">life</span>  <span class="text-highlight">without</span> of <span class="text-highlight">control</span> and the<span class="text-highlight">loss of control</span> really <span class="text-highlight">extended</span> beyond just be the <span class="text-highlight">impact</span> of a <span class="text-highlight">health condition</span>. For example, <span class="text-highlight">herpes patients</span> were portrayed as being <span class="text-highlight">incapacitated</span> for days, <span class="text-highlight">insomniacs</span> utterly out of sync on the job and <span class="text-highlight">depressed patients</span> <span class="text-highlight">friendless</span> and <span class="text-highlight">boring</span> at parties. When the character has been shown taking the drug, he then  <span class="text-highlight">magically</span>  <span class="text-highlight">regained</span> <span class="text-highlight">complete control</span> of his life. None of the ads of course mentioned <span class="text-highlight">lifestyle changes</span> that could also <span class="text-highlight">help</span> <span class="text-highlight">treat</span> the <span class="text-highlight">condition</span> after all its mass marketing but in this case Frosh says <span class="text-highlight">prescription medications</span> are <span class="text-highlight">not like soap</span>.`,

She firstly explained that consumers visit their doctors requiring a prescription drug they saw on TV.

They went to  <span class="text-highlight">talk</span>  they soon developed from simple cafes, where anyone with a penny could go for a drink and a  <span class="text-highlight">chat</span>  into  <span class="text-highlight">clubs</span> .People started to go the coffee houses where they would <span class="text-highlight">find</span> other  <span class="text-highlight">people</span> who had the  <span class="text-highlight">same jobs</span> or who <span class="text-highlight">shared</span> their <span class="text-highlight">interests</span> and <span class="text-highlight">ideas</span> to  <span class="text-highlight">talk</span> and <span class="text-highlight">conduct business</span> . The <span class="text-highlight">great</span>  <span class="text-highlight">popularity</span> of coffee houses  <span class="text-highlight">lasted</span>  about  <span class="text-highlight">100 years</span>  and the later  <span class="text-highlight">18th century</span> <span class="text-highlight">increased</span>  <span class="text-highlight">trade</span>  with  <span class="text-highlight">other countries</span>  made such luxuries as <span class="text-highlight">coffee</span>  <span class="text-highlight">cheaper</span> and more easily <span class="text-highlight">available</span> to the ordinary person. As a result, people started to drink it at home. Also, at this time, more tea was imported from abroad and the century of the <span class="text-highlight">coffee house</span> was <span class="text-highlight">replaced</span> by the <span class="text-highlight">domestic</span>  <span class="text-highlight">tea party</span> as the <span class="text-highlight">typical</span>  English <span class="text-highlight">social location</span>.`,
    solution: `The talk delineated a detailed picture regarding coffee houses in English, which is famous for being a nation of tea drinkers. According to the lecture, people did not go the coffee houses to drink coffee, they went there to have various conversations and even conduct business. However, coffee houses were replaced by the domestic tea party as the typical English social location because more tea was easily imported from abroad. _(70 words)_`,

This reflects the environmentalist Maxim <span class="text-highlight">think globally</span> <span class="text-highlight">act locally</span>. <span class="text-highlight">United Kingdom</span>’s <span class="text-highlight">legislative control</span> over the <span class="text-highlight">impacts</span>of <span class="text-highlight">men's</span>  <span class="text-highlight">activity</span> on the <span class="text-highlight">environment</span> is not new. As long ago as the reign of Charles II the <span class="text-highlight">main concern</span> was the <span class="text-highlight">production</span> of <span class="text-highlight">smoke</span> from the <span class="text-highlight">burning</span>of <span class="text-highlight">sea coal</span>. Almost all areas of <span class="text-highlight">trade industry</span> were subject to very detailed <span class="text-highlight">legislative controls</span> at that time. Although some were <span class="text-highlight">governed</span> by <span class="text-highlight">self-regulation</span> in the form of guilds who <span class="text-highlight">regulated</span> both <span class="text-highlight">supply</span> and <span class="text-highlight">method of production</span>, however, the <span class="text-highlight">measures</span> <span class="text-highlight">implemented</span> were <span class="text-highlight">mostly ineffective</span> because then as now the specifying the <span class="text-highlight">legal duties</span> and <span class="text-highlight">standards</span> without providing any <span class="text-highlight">appropriate</span> <span class="text-highlight">enforcement</span>, Melly indicated good <span class="text-highlight">intentions</span> but were little <span class="text-highlight">practical</span> <span class="text-highlight">effect</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">next stage</span> was prompted by the <span class="text-highlight">Industrial Revolution</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">urbanization</span> of society and its <span class="text-highlight">profound</span> <span class="text-highlight">impact</span> on the <span class="text-highlight">environment</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Local industrialists</span> use the <span class="text-highlight">Adam Smith model</span> to <span class="text-highlight">maximize</span>their <span class="text-highlight">economic benefit</span>, but this was <span class="text-highlight">detriment</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">local environment</span> with the <span class="text-highlight">operation</span> of Gresham’s law, that is a bad drives out the good.

Where is the debt coming from? It's coming from a <span class="text-highlight">seed</span> that is costing hundred thousand to 200,000 rupees per kilogram depending on what you got.  <span class="text-highlight">Seed</span> that <span class="text-highlight">used to</span>  be  <span class="text-highlight">free</span>, used to be there, <span class="text-highlight">pesticides</span> each time the <span class="text-highlight">more</span> they <span class="text-highlight">use</span> , the  <span class="text-highlight">more</span> they <span class="text-highlight">have to</span>  <span class="text-highlight">use</span>. 12 sprays 15 sprays 20 sprays pesticide used in just the last five years in areas that India has showed up by 2,000%.

Oh sure, I knew the loans were <span class="text-highlight">piling up</span> as I went through school. But with one loan coming from here, another from there, I had no idea of the rockslide that was building. Fifteen years later, I still <span class="text-highlight">experience</span> moments of <span class="text-highlight">horror</span> regarding my <span class="text-highlight">family</span> ’s <span class="text-highlight">financial situation</span>. My <span class="text-highlight">monthly</span> <span class="text-highlight">student loan</span>  <span class="text-highlight">payment</span> is more than <span class="text-highlight">triple</span> my <span class="text-highlight">car payment</span>. Ok, so <span class="text-highlight">without</span> my <span class="text-highlight">college degree</span>. I would  not have been able to get my <span class="text-highlight">current job</span>. For that I’m grateful; but at what cost? My loans have been accruing at a rate of 10 percent, and now they have <span class="text-highlight">burgeoned</span> to-well, I’m an English major, you do the math. I don’t think they’ll ever get<span class="text-highlight">paid off</span>. We’re <span class="text-highlight">in debt</span> way past our eyeballs, and there’s <span class="text-highlight">no hope</span> in sight.

The study revealed that a <span class="text-highlight">dramatic</span> <span class="text-highlight">increase</span> in <span class="text-highlight">children</span>'s <span class="text-highlight">depression</span> can <span class="text-highlight">increase</span> the <span class="text-highlight">risk</span> of <span class="text-highlight">life</span>, for example, <span class="text-highlight">long-term</span> <span class="text-highlight">illnesses</span>, such as <span class="text-highlight">diabetes</span> and <span class="text-highlight">heart disease</span> were my impression. One of the studies shows <span class="text-highlight">children</span>  with  <span class="text-highlight">depression</span>  <span class="text-highlight">behave differently</span> and <span class="text-highlight">respond differently</span> to <span class="text-highlight">medical treatment</span>.

Another aspect of it is what's called <span class="text-highlight">devolution</span>, <span class="text-highlight">reducing</span>  <span class="text-highlight">moving</span> <span class="text-highlight">governmental power</span>,  <span class="text-highlight">federal</span>, to the <span class="text-highlight">state level</span>. And that has a kind of a <span class="text-highlight">rationale</span>, which you hear all over the place. For example, it was an outfit a couple of weeks ago, in the New York Times by John Colgan Hoover Institute, at Stanford, who's pointed out what he called a <span class="text-highlight">philosophical</span>  <span class="text-highlight">issue</span> that divides the <span class="text-highlight">Democrats</span> and the <span class="text-highlight">Republicans</span>.

    transcript: `Ever try to get a <span class="text-highlight">baby</span> to <span class="text-highlight">smile</span>? It can seem close to impossible and then suddenly there it is: that <span class="text-highlight">elusive</span>, seemingly <span class="text-highlight">joyous</span>  <span class="text-highlight">grin</span>. Well it turns out those <span class="text-highlight">smiles</span> aren’t <span class="text-highlight">spontaneous</span>, they’re <span class="text-highlight">strategic</span>. Researchers have found that when <span class="text-highlight">babies</span>  <span class="text-highlight">smile</span>, it's for a <span class="text-highlight">reason</span>. They want whoever they’re interacting with typically a parent to <span class="text-highlight">smile</span> <span class="text-highlight">back</span>. And they time it just so, a smile here and a smile there. The <span class="text-highlight">researchers</span> call it <span class="text-highlight">sophisticated</span>  <span class="text-highlight">timing</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">study</span> is in the journal Plos One. The researchers <span class="text-highlight">enlisted</span> real <span class="text-highlight">mothers</span> and <span class="text-highlight">infants</span> and  <span class="text-highlight">quantified</span>  their <span class="text-highlight">interactions</span>, which fell into <span class="text-highlight">four</span> <span class="text-highlight">categories</span>. One: babies wanted to <span class="text-highlight">maximize</span> the amount of <span class="text-highlight">time smiling</span> at their <span class="text-highlight">mothers</span>. Two: they wanted to <span class="text-highlight">maximize</span> the <span class="text-highlight">time</span> the <span class="text-highlight">mothers</span> <span class="text-highlight">smiled at</span> them. Three: they wanted to <span class="text-highlight">experience</span> <span class="text-highlight">simultaneous smiling</span>, and four: <span class="text-highlight">no smiling</span> at all. By studying when <span class="text-highlight">smiles</span> happened and what the <span class="text-highlight">subsequent effect</span> was, the<span class="text-highlight">investigators</span> were able to <span class="text-highlight">figure out</span> that for mothers the goal 70 percent of the time was to be <span class="text-highlight">smiling simultaneously</span>, while for babies <span class="text-highlight">80 percent</span> of the time they just <span class="text-highlight">wanted</span> their <span class="text-highlight">mother</span> <span class="text-highlight">smiling at</span> them. So, <span class="text-highlight">mothers</span>  <span class="text-highlight">want</span> the <span class="text-highlight">interaction</span>, while <span class="text-highlight">babies</span> just <span class="text-highlight">want</span> to be <span class="text-highlight">smiled at</span>. So your baby may not be able to <span class="text-highlight">feed itself</span>, talk or even <span class="text-highlight">turn over</span> yet. But when it comes to smiles, babies seem to <span class="text-highlight">know</span> <span class="text-highlight">exactly</span> what they're up to.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about how to get a baby to smile. He firstly indicated the reason why babies smile is because they want whoever they are interacting with to smile back.

    topic: "University Competition",
    transcript: `Today <span class="text-highlight">university</span> like the LSE (London School of Economics) certainly has to acknowledge that it's  <span class="text-highlight">a competition for the best students</span>, all of whom have chosen, they can <span class="text-highlight">exercise</span> and many of them choose they can <span class="text-highlight">run across nations and continental borders</span>. We are in competition of the staff. The <span class="text-highlight">academic job market</span> is one of the most global there is. In the 21st century English is the new Latin. So universities in <span class="text-highlight">English speaking countries</span> are exposed to <span class="text-highlight">more intensive competitions</span> than elsewhere. We are in competition for government funding through the assessment of research quality. We are in competition for <span class="text-highlight">research contracts from public and private sources</span>, and indeed, we are in competition for the philanthropic pound. Many of our own donors were at more than one university. And indeed, think of the LSE request alongside: there are other charities to which they are committed. That is <span class="text-highlight">a competitive environment</span> which is practically visible to our chancellors.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about competitions at many universities across nations and continental borders. He firstly indicated the importance of the academic job market in the current century. In addition, he had a discussion on a more intensive competition for the search contracts from both public and private sources, as well as for government funding through the assessment of research quality. Finally, he reemphasized a competitive environment for other charity activities. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Talent war</span>! I think there is <span class="text-highlight">an intense competition</span> at the moment to hire <span class="text-highlight">the most talented</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the most intellectually able people</span>. There is a time when I think companies had many of the adventures in the world, that it was the company's world, it will be the bosses’ world. <br/> <br /> Now, I think the reverse is the case. We have <span class="text-highlight">a shortage of talent</span> both within countries and between countries: have <span class="text-highlight">intense battle between companies</span> trying to hire the most talented workers and also between countries which are looking to recruit <span class="text-highlight">talented young people</span>, <span class="text-highlight">talented young immigrants</span>. We have these senses of immigrants being things that countries are battling to keep out and immigrants trying to get in, climb over the walls. I think the opposite is, in fact, the case. And the topic is that countries are trying to woo bright young people to get them to go to the universities and get them to become immigrants. So, on many, many levels, time that is a premium, there is a shortage of talent. And so, <span class="text-highlight">countries, companies, all sorts of organizations</span>, of course, voluntary organization as well as are competing to <span class="text-highlight">hire the best and the brightest</span>. You know, we have <span class="text-highlight">a baby boomer population which is aging</span>. We have <span class="text-highlight">an economy which is becoming more sophisticated</span>. And for other sorts of reasons, <span class="text-highlight">talent is the premium</span>.`,

    topic: "Urbanization Development (or Agriculture and Urbanization)",
    transcript: `I'm trying here to capture the dynamic that just conventionally been associated with <span class="text-highlight">urbanization development</span>. And it gets back once again to this question of <span class="text-highlight">agriculture</span>. Once you have cities you also as a reflection of cities, you have the countryside, you have <span class="text-highlight">rural areas</span> that have this relationship with <span class="text-highlight">urban areas</span> and at mediated by the production of <span class="text-highlight">agricultural goods</span>. And then the trade of those are increasingly <span class="text-highlight">industrial goods</span>. Increasing an agricultural productivity <span class="text-highlight">reduces labour needs and opportunities in rural areas</span>, pushing people towards the city's. There's this notion that in order to have progress and developments in cities, you need people. If everybody is busy growing crops, growing food to simply subsist, you can have people going into the city, you need to <span class="text-highlight">increase productivity in the countryside</span>. You need to have one farmer produce enough food more than one family. And then you will have growth and productivity in the countryside which will free up people to move to the cities. In fact, in many ways, it will compel them to <span class="text-highlight">move to the cities</span> because they won't be able to make a living in the countryside anymore. They will go to the cities <span class="text-highlight">in search of jobs</span> and provide <span class="text-highlight">a labour force</span> for <span class="text-highlight">the production of all kinds of other things</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the dynamic that conventionally associated with urbanization development. He firstly indicated that an increase in agricultural productivities can reduce labour needs and opportunities in rural areas, then this may push people towards the city.

    topic: "Globalization v1",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Globalization</span>, what is globalization?
I think that he takes on <span class="text-highlight">a few different definitions</span> in one sense of the word. Globalization means <span class="text-highlight">a proliferation of transactions across country</span>. So, one way of thinking about globalization is a way to describe, increase <span class="text-highlight">international communications</span>, more <span class="text-highlight">trade happening between countries</span> and  be less self-sufficient in <span class="text-highlight">providing goods and services</span> to their people and more companies that have offices in <span class="text-highlight">multiple countries</span>, which we call <span class="text-highlight">multinationals</span>. So, <span class="text-highlight">the source of growth in travel and communication</span> and corporate <span class="text-highlight">increases across borders</span>. And this way of thinking about globalization is the continuation of thinking that has been around for a long time, such as when the Europeans went to the Orient, to find spices, which was also an example of <span class="text-highlight">global trade and communication</span>. Another way to think of globalization though, is <span class="text-highlight">an economic system</span>. It is a system in which countries become <span class="text-highlight">integrated</span> in a way that never had been before. In this system, we see a global split in the process between <span class="text-highlight">consuming and producing goods</span>. Some countries produce goods, some countries, consumer goods, and then these countries in different areas of the globe depend on each other in a kind of organic solar directly rather than having an economic system being just inside your country. The system is the way economy in your country functions depends on economic economy of the country. And in fact this way of thinking about globalization's represents a new area of <span class="text-highlight">economic progression</span> the past industrially industrialist economy that has been <span class="text-highlight">a global issue</span>`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about globalization which is a proliferation of transactions across countries. Globalization involves international communications and trades happening between nations. It is by providing goods and services in multinationals, the source of growth in travel and communication increases significantly across borders. He finally indicated that the way of thinking about globalization represents a new area of economic progression in which countries of the globe depend on each other. (70 words)`,

    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Chromosomes</span> are found in the <span class="text-highlight">nucleus sub-cells</span>. The key factors are chromosomes contain a molecule <span class="text-highlight">DNA</span>. Scientist said that DNA is <span class="text-highlight">a genetic material</span> and not because our DNA determines our <span class="text-highlight">inherited features</span>. I’m showing you <span class="text-highlight">a structure of DNA</span> here. This is a simplified structure but it covers all the points that you need for combined science. DNA consists of <span class="text-highlight">two strands</span>, each strand is <span class="text-highlight">a polymer</span>. In another word, each strand is made by <span class="text-highlight">joining together lots of smaller molecules</span>. In DNA, the two strands are wrapped around each other to form a double helix. It’s really important that you learn the term double helix as it’s a very common exam question. So, as we said, DNA’s found in chromosomes. I’m showing you a picture of chromosome here. Now the key factors are <span class="text-highlight">the gene</span>, it’s the small section of DNA on the chromosome. And again, you need to learn that definition. So, I’m showing here a gene. For example, this could be the gene which determines your blood type. This gene is found on chromosome number nine. Each gene encoded for specific sequence of amino acid to make a specific protein. For example, the blood type gene encoded the sequence of amino acid for the protein that determines blood type. Now humans have literally thousands of genes. We’re going to finish now by looking at <span class="text-highlight">the genome</span>. The genome is <span class="text-highlight">the entire genetic material of an organism</span>. So, the human genome is the entire genetic material that makes a human.`,

    transcript: `But you can see from the relatively crooked and narrow streets of the city of Rome as they look from above today.
    <span class="text-highlight">The city grew in a fairly ad hoc way</span>. <span class="text-highlight">It wasn’t planned</span> all at once. It just grew up over time, beginning in the eighth century BC. Now this is interesting. Because what we know about the Romans is when they were left to their own devices and they could <span class="text-highlight">build a city from scratch</span> they didn’t let it grow in an ad hoc way. They, they structured it in a, in a very care, very <span class="text-highlight">methodical way</span>.  that was <span class="text-highlight">basically based on military strategy</span>, <span class="text-highlight">military planning</span>. The Romans they could not have conquered the world without obviously having <span class="text-highlight">a masterful military enterprise</span>. And they everywhere they went on their various <span class="text-highlight">campaigns</span>, their various military campaigns., they would build, <span class="text-highlight">build camps</span> and those camps were always laid out in a very geometric plan along a grid, usually square or rectangular. So when we begin to see the Romans building their ideal Roman city, they turn to that so-called cestrum, or military camp design, and they build their cities that way.</p>`,

    topic: "Music and Language",
    transcript: `Every human culture that we know of, has <span class="text-highlight">music and language</span>, these are universal, genuine human universal when they go way back in our specie’s history. So the question of what these two things might have in common has occurred to a lot of people when it’s sort of intuitive, they both involve <span class="text-highlight">complex sequences</span> that unfold in time, they both <span class="text-highlight">forms of communication</span>, it’s interested philosophers since Plato going back over 2000 years, scientists including Darwin who wrote about possible evolutionary links between music and language in his book “The Descent of Man”, an artist including Leonard Bernstein who gave a set of lectures at Harvard in the 70s about possible connections between the grammar of music and the grammar of language according to Noam Chomsky theories. So it’s a persistent question and I think it continues to draw interest from scientists today, because they are just some <span class="text-highlight">basic obvious similarities</span>. For example, both music and language have <span class="text-highlight">rhythm</span> by which I mean <span class="text-highlight">systematic patterns</span> of <span class="text-highlight">timing, accent and grouping</span>. They both have <span class="text-highlight">melody</span>, meaning structured patterns of pitch over time. And they both have <span class="text-highlight">syntax</span>, mean discrete elements like notes or words and principles for combining those elements into sequences, sentences are just random sequences of verbs, and music melodies and compositions are far from random sequences of notes, they are principles. And they both <span class="text-highlight">convey emotion</span> or effect using sound, you can tell somebody’s <span class="text-highlight">emotions</span> from sound of their voice, or you can get a lot of emotional information about music is conveying happiness or sadness or mixed emotions.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about basic obvious similarities between music and language in human culture. He firstly indicated that both music and language have complex sequences and syntax. Moreover, he explained that both music and language have rhythm, which is the pattern of timing and accent. Furthermore, they both have melody and convey emotion by using sounds.

    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">How climate will affect crops</span>, but <span class="text-highlight">crops affect climate</span> themselves. And they do this in two ways. First of all, about one quarter of the land surface is used for growing crops. Another 10 -15% are used for passenger. <span class="text-highlight">A substantial amount of the land surface</span> is used in <span class="text-highlight">crop and agricultural production</span>. How we use that land affects our climate. If we were, for example, to <span class="text-highlight">deforest a substantial area</span> and <span class="text-highlight">replace it with annual crops</span> such as soybean, we would <span class="text-highlight">alter the characteristics of the land surface</span>, alter the way that water and heat flows from the land surface to the atmosphere and back; and ultimately change the regional climate if there is a large enough change of the land surface.  So, this is an absolutely <span class="text-highlight">fascinating topic</span> and one that’s really quite <span class="text-highlight">difficult to understand</span> because of the complexity.  It is difficult because it needs us as crop scientists to work even more closely with our climate scientists, colleagues, and it is difficult because we have to join our models together.`,

    topic: "Child Language Acquisition",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Child language acquisition</span>, three little words. So let’s take them on at a time. Child, when to start being a child? For many people, language acquisition <span class="text-highlight">starts around twelve months</span> <span class="text-highlight">when kids say that first word</span>, but don’t forget the first year. At the first year, our first year of life is very important as well and indeed before you are born, remember there are a couple of <span class="text-highlight">months before you are born</span>, when you are actually able to <span class="text-highlight">perceive in the womb</span>, something of <span class="text-highlight">the language that’s around you</span>. So language acquisition starts earlier than most people think. And it also ends later than most people think. When does child language acquisition stop? Well, in a sense, you know, we are all children, we stay being children all in our lives. There is <span class="text-highlight">no obvious endpoint for learning sounds</span>, of course, there is for learning <span class="text-highlight">grammar</span>, there is for <span class="text-highlight">vocabulary</span>, huh. I mean that goes on for the rest of our lives in million or more words in English. Most of us only have a vocabulary of 50, 60, 70 thousand words, whatever it is until there is always something more to learn. So remember that <span class="text-highlight">the two ends of child language acquisition are wider apart</span> than some people think. That means there is more scope for studying it than most people think.`,

Instincts are also often discussed in relation to motivation, since they can also occur in response to an <span class="text-highlight">organism’s need</span> to satisfy some innate internal drive, tied to survival.<br/><br/>
    Instincts are <span class="text-highlight">present across species</span> and <span class="text-highlight">consistent within individual species</span>. In other words, many different species rely on instincts, and if one member of a species possesses an instinct, then they all do.<br/><br/>
    Before we move into a discussion of specific types of instincts, it is important to distinguish the difference between an instinct and a reflex. It is important to <span class="text-highlight">distinguish the difference</span> between an <span class="text-highlight">instinct and a reflex</span>. Both are types of <span class="text-highlight">unlearned behavior</span> that tend to serve a <span class="text-highlight">survival purpose</span>. A reflex is typically a <span class="text-highlight">simple reaction</span> or a response to an environmental trigger.

This is the point of the beginning of this. The more that we look at the Industrial Revolution, the more we see that the Industrial Revolution was first and foremost <span class="text-highlight">an intensification of forms of production</span>, of kinds of production that were already there. Thus, we spend more time looking at the intensification of artisanal production, craft production, domestic industry which we've already mentioned, that is, people, mostly women but also men and children, too, working in the countryside. <span class="text-highlight">The rapid rise of industrial production</span> was very much tied to <span class="text-highlight">traditional forms of production</span>. In Paris, for example, in 1801, or 1870 only, the average unit of production had only slightly more than seven people in it.

    topic: "Renovation of Paris",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Cities</span> are interesting places. Some cities are <span class="text-highlight">carefully planned</span>, built for a reason, and reflect the needs of the people as it grows. Others are <span class="text-highlight">less conscientiously designed</span>. Paris, for example, was originally founded in the 3rd century as a small village and with every passing generation, it grew in size and importance. It grew from a medieval city to a modern city, but the transition was not always smooth. Emperor Napoleon III had to hire someone to oversee the rebuilding of Paris. The man he chose was Georges-Eugène Haussmann.<br/><br/>
    In <span class="text-highlight">1853</span>, Haussmann began <span class="text-highlight">the process of renovating France's capital city</span>. His <span class="text-highlight">basic instructions</span> were to bring light and air into the central districts, improve the sanitation and living areas, and make Paris a more modern, beautiful city. Not your average weekend renovation. Haussmann's projects included the destruction of old, medieval neighborhoods, widening of streets, building large parks and public squares, and addition of fountains and sewer lines. To add to all of this, the size of Paris had to be increased - doubled, actually - and Napoleon III issued official decrees annexing nearby suburbs to make them part of the city.<br/><br/>
    One of <span class="text-highlight">the main priorities</span> of this massive renovation was to <span class="text-highlight">connect all of the districts</span> together. If we think of Paris like a house, each district was its own room, existing essentially independently of the other districts. Napoleon III wanted it to be easier to travel between the most important districts and to create a sense of this being one unified city, not a series of independent neighborhoods. So Haussman created <span class="text-highlight">large avenues</span> that connected the districts. More than that, he made all the avenues look roughly the same. Buildings on a major avenue were required to be roughly the same height and style, and even had to use the same cream-colored stone for the façade. The result was to remove any local characteristics and create a uniform Paris. For the first time, the city had <span class="text-highlight">a specific look</span>, <span class="text-highlight">a style</span> that people began to <span class="text-highlight">associate</span> not with <span class="text-highlight">a district</span>, but with <span class="text-highlight">Paris itself</span>.`,

    transcript: `In this video we're going to find out how <span class="text-highlight">animal bones</span> found in <span class="text-highlight">an island cave</span> in the Adriatic Sea tells us about <span class="text-highlight">the movement of people</span> during the last place your maximum from research carried out by PS Bry. Marquez. <span class="text-highlight">23,000 years ago</span>, towards the end of the Old Stone Age, also known as the upper Paleolithic, <span class="text-highlight">the weather in Europe</span> and in many parts of the world <span class="text-highlight">took a turn for the worse</span>. Temperatures plummeted, rain levels fell and a massive ice sheet slowly advanced to cover most of northern Europe and stay there for the next few thousand years. We know that during this <span class="text-highlight">glacial period</span>, many animal and plant species sought shelter in Europe's three warmer southern peninsulas, Iberia, Italy, and the Balkans. But the question is, where did the people go? Archeological material recovered from this time period has shown that a large number of our <span class="text-highlight">ancestors</span> retreated to Franco Cantabria, an area covering <span class="text-highlight">the southwest of France</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the northeastern tip of Spain</span>. But was this the only area where people traveled to escape the worst of the weather? Let's go back to the <span class="text-highlight">growing ice sheet</span>. In order to grow, the ice mass had to take up water, causing sea levels to fall. At its maximum when the ice reached as far south as Germany, sea levels were up to 120 meters lower than today. That's approximately the same height as the London Eye. As a result, areas of the shallow sea became exposed and Europe's shape was very different from the one we recognized. It could be that humans lived on these exposed shores during the Paleolithic, but we have <span class="text-highlight">no evidence of their settlements</span> because it's now all <span class="text-highlight">underwater</span>.`,

So in terms of our <span class="text-highlight">total volume of water</span> in the world yesterday is <span class="text-highlight">changing</span>, but it's not changing significantly relative to the rate at which we are using or demanding fresh new water.
    Now, there are a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different areas of technology</span> involved in <span class="text-highlight">water recycling</span>. And we are later in the interview going to get to industrial use and the reclamation of sewage. What about in the home at the moment what <span class="text-highlight">sort of technology</span> is being utilized in the home when we talk about water recycling? Well, very little on average, typically, in a modern home, we turn on the tap. We take a glass of water, we probably interning on that tab, flush 10 glasses of water down the sink. We take a shower, we use fresh water, we do a whole range of things. And there is nominally very little recycling of that. It goes down the drain and it goes off to a wastewater treatment plant. There is actually very, very little recycling <span class="text-highlight">at a local level</span>. People don't actually say: Well, I'm now going to take the water I just used, put it through a sophisticated process and reuse it and have a closed loop. It's not a closed loop in the home.`,

    Because this course is <span class="text-highlight">risk analysis</span>. So what do we mean by risk? And when you go to the dictionary and you look at the definition of risk, this is the definition of risk. What do you see is these definitions for example, a <span class="text-highlight">possibility of loss</span> or injury, a <span class="text-highlight">dangerous element</span>to factor the <span class="text-highlight">chance of loss</span>, the degree the <span class="text-highlight">probability</span> and so on. So <span class="text-highlight">risk has two parts</span> to it, as you look at the literal definition of risk is <span class="text-highlight">a consequence</span> of some kind, which has <span class="text-highlight">a danger</span>, has its loss.
    And the other aspect of it is <span class="text-highlight">probability</span>. Okay. So, even in the literal definition of risk, there are these two parts of <span class="text-highlight">chance</span> and <span class="text-highlight">consequence</span>. Okay. And then, at least as far as the English language is concerned, when you look up the word <span class="text-highlight">safe</span> <span class="text-highlight">safety</span>, what you notice is a little bit of a <span class="text-highlight">circular argument</span>, but <span class="text-highlight">free from risk</span> <span class="text-highlight">secure</span>, or <span class="text-highlight">danger</span>, <span class="text-highlight">condition of being safe</span>, and so on and so forth. And what I take out of that, at least at the level we're discussing today, when we're talking about safe, at least in English language, we're talking about an <span class="text-highlight">absolute</span> something is either safe or it's not safe.`,

    transcript: `So I'm going to talk a little bit briefly about <span class="text-highlight">different systems of memory</span>. And in fact, much of the memory that <span class="text-highlight">influences</span> and <span class="text-highlight">guides</span> out our everyday life actually kind of <span class="text-highlight">hide in the background</span>, you actually don't know that when you're using the <span class="text-highlight">bulk of your memory.</span> And this is called <span class="text-highlight">implicit</span> or <span class="text-highlight">procedural</span> <span class="text-highlight">memory</span>. This includes things like <span class="text-highlight">cultural</span> and <span class="text-highlight">social</span> <span class="text-highlight">norms</span>. So kind of understanding how you're supposed to behave in a classroom or expecting a certain thing to happen when you walk into a restaurant. These are all things that we've learned and acquired over the years. But it's not necessarily something that we think about. language, also, in many aspects is something that is fairly <span class="text-highlight">automatic</span>, and that we've acquired and us very <span class="text-highlight">naturally</span> and other learned skills such as reading or driving, these are things that might have been <span class="text-highlight">effortful</span> at one time, but now they just come very <span class="text-highlight">easily</span> and <span class="text-highlight">automatically</span> to us. And in fact, if you actually try to describe to somebody how you drive, or how to drive, you actually kind of messes you up. So these are in a lot of women, a lot of cases, <span class="text-highlight">consciousness</span> kind of gets in the way of a lot of these aspects of influence memory. Now when we're talking about our memory, so for instance, people tell me a lot, that their memories are bad, when people are saying when they talk about their memory, they usually talking about <span class="text-highlight">explicit</span> or <span class="text-highlight">episodic</span> <span class="text-highlight">memory</span>. And these are very different from <span class="text-highlight">implicit memories</span>. These are memories that have a very <span class="text-highlight">specific tag</span> of <span class="text-highlight">space</span> and <span class="text-highlight">time</span>. These are highly <span class="text-highlight">personal memories</span>, usually.

    topic: "The Travels Sir John Mandeville",
    transcript: `But if you were to go to a library at the end of the 1300s, or through the 1400s, you would probably find a <span class="text-highlight">book</span> that was then, way more popular than those <span class="text-highlight">titles</span> we still read, a book that purported to be a <span class="text-highlight">description of the world</span>, a <span class="text-highlight">guide</span> the traveling and distant lands of BC area and Almanac of everything that was just off the horizon. I am not talking about Marco Polo. No, I'm talking about something far far, weirder and far, far less tethered to reality, a volume of medieval fantasy masquerading as a field guide called <span class="text-highlight">The travels of Sir John Mandeville</span>, supposedly the titular night set out from England in the 1330s and embarked on a journey that would take him to the <span class="text-highlight">Middle East</span>, <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Asia</span>, though as it will become apparent, not a Middle East, not in Africa and not an Asia that we would recognize here in reality. No Mandeville spoke. It's not really about actually real foreign lands. It's about what <span class="text-highlight">Europeans</span> thought was just outside the <span class="text-highlight">bounds of their civilizations</span>. It's about what's beyond that mountain range that marks the borders of the lands. You know, it's about what medieval people thought the foreign looks like.

    transcript: `So the title of my lecture today is Heinz 57, the <span class="text-highlight">history of English</span> and the <span class="text-highlight">rise of English</span> as a <span class="text-highlight">global language</span>. I know that John Slack gave you a lecture on English, the global language that right you've had to run. Oh, he's going to say, the end of my lecture will lead on to what John Slack's going to talk to you about next time. So there'll be a link, and I've called my lecture, Heinz 57. Because English, as you've already read, is, is <span class="text-highlight">not a pure language</span>. I don't think there really are any pure languages in the world. But English is definitely not a pure language. English, in fact, has <span class="text-highlight">borrowed</span> from over <span class="text-highlight">350 languages</span> in its history. So it's a <span class="text-highlight">variety of many languages</span>. Some people say it's like a dog, a Mongol dog, a dog that's been made up of many different dogs. The English language is like that. And by looking at the <span class="text-highlight">history of the English language</span>, we learn about the <span class="text-highlight">history of the English people</span>, the two things are <span class="text-highlight">closely connected</span>. So in fact, today, we're not <span class="text-highlight">learning about language</span>, but we're <span class="text-highlight">learning about history</span>. And fact, the English has borrowed words from over 350 languages, has been <span class="text-highlight">viewed differently</span> throughout history. So for example, in <span class="text-highlight">Shakespeare's time</span>, people were very <span class="text-highlight">angry</span> about words which were not they thought <span class="text-highlight">original English words</span> - words, which came from other languages they didn't like them. During <span class="text-highlight">times of war</span> for is, for example, World War II, German words were they tried to remove German words from the English language, but as we'll see from the lecture today, that was very difficult because the <span class="text-highlight">basis of English</span> lies in <span class="text-highlight">Germanic languages</span>, so it was very hard to remove all German words from the English language.`,

    topic: "Where Earthquakes occur?",
    transcript: `So we have a <span class="text-highlight">fault plane</span>, and then the <span class="text-highlight">earthquake</span> itself <span class="text-highlight">occurred</span> on this fault plane, the earthquake starts at a particular point on the fault plane. And we call that the <span class="text-highlight">focus of the earthquake</span>.  And then the <span class="text-highlight">rupture</span> <span class="text-highlight">propagates out</span> from that point on the <span class="text-highlight">rupture plane</span> to <span class="text-highlight">cover the entire fault plane</span>. That ruptures in that particular earthquake. We talked about the <span class="text-highlight">epicenter of an earthquake</span> a lot, the epicenter is just the <span class="text-highlight">surface projection</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">focus of the earthquake</span>. So if we wanted to look in <span class="text-highlight">map view</span> of where the earthquake was located, and we were able to look down into the earth, we would see the focus down at some depth on the earth, and the epicenter is just the point <span class="text-highlight">vertically above</span> that focus at the <span class="text-highlight">surface of the earth</span>. Okay. So this is the <span class="text-highlight">relationship between fault and earthquakes</span>. This <span class="text-highlight">block model</span> that you can see here is the same block model that we were just looking at, it's a <span class="text-highlight">thrust fault</span> of some kind. So we have rupture on this thrust fault. And as a result of that rupture, we see a <span class="text-highlight">seismic wave</span> <span class="text-highlight">radiated away</span> from the fault, so we get this <span class="text-highlight">displacement</span> on the fault and <span class="text-highlight">radiated seismic ways</span> away from the fault.`,

Now, there are many <span class="text-highlight">definitions of creativity</span>, perhaps almost as many of people who study it, but here's my address of a common type of statement. Creativity refers to the <span class="text-highlight">phenomenon</span> whereby <span class="text-highlight">human activity generates something new</span>, that has <span class="text-highlight">some kind of value</span>.

Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. And for me, that's absolutely the <span class="text-highlight">pleasure</span> and even on good days, <span class="text-highlight">the joy of doing organization studies</span>, because it enables you not just enables, but requires you, in some sense, to have some kind of <span class="text-highlight">broad familiarization</span> of that sort. Now, there's a price to be paid for that. Because that kind of breadth, if you like, though I suppose that the <span class="text-highlight">cost of depth</span>, and I guess there would be people who are clearly within<span class="text-highlight">academic disciplines</span> of <span class="text-highlight">sociology</span> or <span class="text-highlight">economics</span>or whatever, who might say, well, these are sort of magpie-sh, amateurish kind of forays into our territory.

    transcript: `There can now be no <span class="text-highlight">reasonable, science-based doubt</span> about the reality of <span class="text-highlight">global climate change effects</span> brought on by the <span class="text-highlight">cumulative and rapidly growing emission</span> of so-called <span class="text-highlight">"greenhouse" gases</span> - primarily <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide</span> - into the atmosphere. As these effects become <span class="text-highlight">increasingly more obvious</span> worldwide, so commercial interests, <span class="text-highlight">groups of concerned individuals and national governments</span> have been gripped by what amounts to mass panic about what to do about it.<br/><br/> To many, Paul Ehrlich's Malthusian "Population Bomb" of 1968 appears about to explode in the world's face in an indirect version of his millenarian vision of <span class="text-highlight">population growth</span> which <span class="text-highlight">outpaces agricultural production capacity</span> - with predictably <span class="text-highlight">catastrophic results for humanity</span>. And his three-part crisis scenario does indeed seem now to be present: a <span class="text-highlight">rapid rate of change</span>, a limit of some sort, and <span class="text-highlight">delays in perceiving that limit</span>. Ehrlich's work was roundly criticised at the time, and later, from many quarters, and much of what he predicted did not come about. Nevertheless, can the world afford to take the risk that the <span class="text-highlight">climate scientists have got it wrong</span>? Is it not in everyone's interests to apply the Precautionary Principle in attempting to avoid the worst of their predictions - now, rather than at some future time? As the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Mr. Rajendra Pachauri, has recently pointed out, <span class="text-highlight">eleven of the warmest years since instrumental records began have occurred in the past twelve</span>, while <span class="text-highlight">major precipitation changes are taking place</span> on a global scale.`,

    topic: "Design of buildings",
    transcript: `Just think of the various <span class="text-highlight">catastrophic failures of Victorian architecture</span> that stood and fail. Here is the disastrous Milbank penitentiary, great prison built underside of Tate Britain, our predecessors let this go. And we now <span class="text-highlight">look back with the same sense of self of relief</span>. Thank goodness we don't have to spend our time <span class="text-highlight">keeping that particular monstrosity standing</span>. But here, I think we come to an incredibly important point.
    When we're dealing with buildings of the Victorian era or earlier, <span class="text-highlight">we're looking at a building stock that has already been rid of the architectural flops</span>. There's been a <span class="text-highlight">process of natural selection</span> in which at thousands of <span class="text-highlight">buildings</span> that were built or designed poorly have already fallen down or <span class="text-highlight">have already been modified and the faults rectified</span>. But <span class="text-highlight">when we're dealing with buildings that are only 50 or 60 years old</span>, <span class="text-highlight">we are often confronting design flaws or poor workmanship</span> that are only just coming to light or only just in the <span class="text-highlight">process of being rectified</span>. This, again, challenges our <span class="text-highlight">perception of authenticity</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Most historic buildings</span> (by which I mean buildings a hundred years or more old) <span class="text-highlight">have been adapted and modified to iron out design and construction flaws</span> and so their so-called original state is, in fact, an altered state in which they perform well, in fact often better than when they were first completed. Late twentieth century buildings are still going through this Darwinian process of natural selection that will decide whether they will survive having been adapted or whether they will die as being unsuited to their function. So <span class="text-highlight">criticizing them for their design flaws may be seen as unfair</span>.`,

We're not into a generic soap, we're into the best, you know, stain removing laundry detergent you're going to buy. But we're going to want you to remember that as the tide brand, now, that means there's a second moment of truth. If they do select you and they pay 50% more than they want to pay for Walmart's brand when they get home, it’d better perform when it's used. And here's where the science starts, folks. There's an amazing <span class="text-highlight">number of fundamental engineering contradictions</span>, right?<br/>
    Airplanes deal with you know, <span class="text-highlight">weight and strength</span>. I want something that's <span class="text-highlight">light, but strong</span>. That's an engineering contradiction.<br/>

So take a look at these four panels.

And one way in which you're a supermodel historians is therefore in focus in terms of <span class="text-highlight">how we interrogate the past</span>, <span class="text-highlight">what elements we use to communicate in the past</span>. Most <span class="text-highlight">academic historians</span>, I trained very much in discipline of words, and they concentrate on words still today. I think all that's changing a little bit. If you go through university history, I think primarily you are encouraged to draw on things like <span class="text-highlight">archival accounts</span>, <span class="text-highlight">manuscripts</span>.

    topic: "Wonder Bilingual Babies",
    transcript: `Another example comes from the other end of life and has to do with what’s called <span class="text-highlight">wonder babies</span>. This was a study which was done a few years ago in Trieste which is basically at the border on Slovenia and Italy. So <span class="text-highlight">there are a lot of Italians</span> and <span class="text-highlight">there are a lot of Slovenians</span> and there are of course a lot of <span class="text-highlight">mixed marriages</span>. What they did was <span class="text-highlight">they took three groups of babies</span>, <span class="text-highlight">all babies were seven months</span> old so there were a bunch of <span class="text-highlight">Italian speaking babies</span>, bunch of <span class="text-highlight">Slovenian speaking babies</span> and a bunch of <span class="text-highlight">Italian-Slovenian babies from mixed families</span>. <span class="text-highlight">They showed those babies various puppets</span> and then they <span class="text-highlight">switched the situation</span>. Typically <span class="text-highlight">when the seven-month-old baby is used to particular setting</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the situation switches</span> <span class="text-highlight">it takes them a little while to regroup</span>. So turned out that seven-month-old Italian and seven-month-old Slovenian babies would <span class="text-highlight">get used to the puppet appearing on the right</span>, and then <span class="text-highlight">when the puppet would appear on the left they would continue looking to the right as if nothing had changed</span>. Whereas <span class="text-highlight">the bilingual babies very quickly would turn their head and notice that the puppet has changed its position</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed a study on three groups of babies from Italia, Slovenia and mixed marriages. She firstly explained that they showed them various puppets and switched the situation. Additionally, Slovenian and Italian babies would get used to the puppet appearing on the right and continue looking to the right when it appeared on the left. However, the bilingual babies would quickly turn their head, and notice the changed position.`,

    topic: "Why study law?",
    transcript: `<p>My name is Graham Virgo, I’m Professor of English Private Law in the Faculty of Law at the University of Cambridge, and I’m going to consider the question <span class="text-highlight">why you should study law if you don’t want to become a lawyer</span>.
    A lot of people who study Law at University do so because they want to become <span class="text-highlight">practising lawyers</span>, whether <span class="text-highlight">barristers or solicitors</span>.
    But <span class="text-highlight">it is not necessary to read Law at University to become a practising lawyer</span>.
    Equally, <span class="text-highlight">studying Law at University is a legitimate subject for academic study</span> even if you definitely do not want to become a lawyer or think that you may not become a practising lawyer.
    That is because <span class="text-highlight">the study of Law at University is not a vocational subject</span>; it is an <span class="text-highlight">academic subject and an intellectual discipline</span>. Even those students who study Law at University intending to become practising lawyers <span class="text-highlight">are required to do additional vocational training</span> to prepare them for working either as a barrister or a solicitor; for them <span class="text-highlight">the study of Law at University by itself is not sufficient to train them to become lawyers.</span>
    So why do such students study law at University and why do others study Law even if they don’t want to become a lawyer?
    The answer is fairly similar in both cases, namely that studying Law at University trains the student to think and write logically and clearly.</p>`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed the question why students should study law even they do not want to become a lawyer. He firstly explained that if students want to become practising lawyers, whether barristers or solicitors, they need to do additional vocational training. Additionally, law is a legitimate subject for academic study and an intellectual discipline. He finally concluded that studying law trains the student to think and write logically and clearly. _(70 words)_`,

Now <span class="text-highlight">the definition academically of super diversity</span> is 25% not born in New Zealand 100 ethnicities. So <span class="text-highlight">we are almost double that number already</span>. And <span class="text-highlight">Auckland will continue to become younger and browner</span> as the Anglo Saxon population ages and shrinks. So <span class="text-highlight">the mega trend here is not age</span>. And the myth the mega trend here is not urbanisation <span class="text-highlight">the mega trend is demography</span>. It's a necessity. And we need to get our head around that because most of the benefits from Super diversity that we as a country are enjoying at the moment, such as <span class="text-highlight">greater innovation, productivity and advancement increase New Zealand's financial capital</span>, whereas <span class="text-highlight">most of the challenges from Super diversity adversely affect New Zealand social capital</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecture delineated the New Zealand’s super diverse future and the status quo of this diversity, predominantly in Auckland. She firstly claimed that most of the challenges from super diversity adversely affect New Zealand social capital. Additionally, she argued that if people do not mitigate the challenges to use social capital, they are not going to maximise sustainably. She finally concluded that the diversity dividend benefits for your financial capital. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Fast Radio Bursts",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Fast radio burst</span> is very much like what it sounds, it's a burst, it's a very <span class="text-highlight">fast burst of radio waves comes from outer space long way away</span>. And by fast, I mean really fast. So <span class="text-highlight">it's starts and stops in about a thousandth of a second</span>. So you click your fingers and it's finished.
    First <span class="text-highlight">radio goes to a real mystery</span>, we <span class="text-highlight">don't really understand exactly where they come from, or what actually makes them</span>. And there's a lot of open questions that we really don't have an answer for. There are probably more theories about what makes Australia but then there are actually actual detections of these things. So since 2007, we've only had 20. But there are probably 30 or 40 different theories on what makes them. The most interesting thing about this burst is the fact that we found that we Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, so that is, it wasn't really obvious that we will be able to do this, as well as we ended up being able to do it. So. So <span class="text-highlight">this telescope is really a fantastic telescope</span>. In fact, <span class="text-highlight">it's probably the best telescope on the planet at the moment for finding these bursts</span>.
    And so whereas in the past, it's taken 1010 years to find 20 bursts, once we're really going with this new instrument will be able to find them much more quickly whenever you can do one or two every week, and that will blow up in the field. So that will make it a much more. You know, <span class="text-highlight">we'll be able to do much more detailed studies of these things</span>, <span class="text-highlight">get better statistics</span>, understand what that hopefully <span class="text-highlight">understand what they are and where they're coming from</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecture delineated the concept of fast radio bursts coming from outer space. He firstly indicated that it is challenging to understand exactly where they come from or what actually makes them. Additionally, he explained different theories based on the findings from fantastic telescopes. He finally concluded that people need to conduct more detailed studies and get better statistics to understand what radio bursts are and where they come from. _(70 words)_`,

Sure, you can see <span class="text-highlight">examples</span> here of the wheel, or the <span class="text-highlight">automobile</span>.

The <span class="text-highlight">evolution</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">washing machine</span>, as demonstrated in this barn is a <span class="text-highlight">representative example</span> of this <span class="text-highlight">changing domestic life</span>. For many centuries, <span class="text-highlight">sailors</span> used to place their clothing in a cloth bag, tie the back to a rope and throw it overboard, letting the ship drag it for hours. The principle was simple, force water through the clothes to remove the dirt. But in the household before running <span class="text-highlight">water</span> and <span class="text-highlight">electricity</span>,
    Washington close to a staggering amount of labour
    to <span class="text-highlight">wash</span>, boil and rent a single load of <span class="text-highlight">clothes</span> to take care gallons of water, which had to be hand carried from my pump or well, hand wringing, rubbing and lifting the clothes could <span class="text-highlight">expose</span> <span class="text-highlight">women</span> to <span class="text-highlight">caustic substances</span> in the setups. The whole <span class="text-highlight">process</span> for <span class="text-highlight">households laundry</span> could take an <span class="text-highlight">entire day</span> or more as back breaking labour, and 1846, a <span class="text-highlight">patented washing machine</span> imitated the <span class="text-highlight">human hand</span> moving cloth over a washboard by using a lever to rub the clothes between two red surfaces. This machine was sold in the US as late as 1927.

What would How would you really <span class="text-highlight">enjoy spending your life?</span> Well, it's so amazing as a result of our kind of <span class="text-highlight">educational system</span>. Crowds of students say, Well, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">painters</span>, we'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">poets</span>. We'd like to be <span class="text-highlight">writers</span>, but as everybody knows, you can't done any money that way.

    Let's go through with it. <span class="text-highlight">What do you want</span>?
    When we finally got down with something which the individual says he <span class="text-highlight">really wants to do</span>?

    topic: "Wildlife in Africa",
    transcript: `In my view, it's impossible to talk about <span class="text-highlight">wildlife</span> and not think about it roughly in 9 years. And I guess part of that is my own <span class="text-highlight">angle</span> and part of the research that I do in <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span>, in both East and West Africa, I look at the role of the <span class="text-highlight">human reliance</span> on wildlife as a <span class="text-highlight">source of food</span>, and also as a <span class="text-highlight">source of income.</span> Can we talk about our wildlife <span class="text-highlight">at sea</span> and we talk about <span class="text-highlight">fish</span>, we're talking about what's probably the <span class="text-highlight">single most important</span> <span class="text-highlight">source of protein</span>for <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">across the globe</span>. So, millions for more than a billion people <span class="text-highlight">rely on fish</span> is their <span class="text-highlight">primary source</span> of <span class="text-highlight">animal protein</span>. And most of these people are living in <span class="text-highlight">poverty</span>. So, the <span class="text-highlight">management</span> of fish resources, wildlife in that sense is of course <span class="text-highlight">incredibly important</span> and livelihoods and health. And also, <span class="text-highlight">wildlife tourism</span> is a multi billion <span class="text-highlight">dollar industry</span> and in many <span class="text-highlight">countries</span>, such as Africa and <span class="text-highlight">South America</span>, and it can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one source of income</span>. It can be the <span class="text-highlight">number one</span> source of <span class="text-highlight">foreign income</span> for <span class="text-highlight">economies</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about wildlife in Africa and the role of human reliance on wildlife as a source of food and income. He firstly argued that many people relying on fish as the primary source of protein are living in poverty. In addition, he suggested that management of fish resources is incredibly important. He finally concluded that wildlife tourism can be the number one source of foreign income for economies. _(70 words)_.`,

    topic: "Music and the brain",
    transcript: `Interest in <span class="text-highlight">music</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">mind</span> is as ancient as philosophy itself. Plato was marveled at the <span class="text-highlight">power of music</span> over human character and <span class="text-highlight">human emotions</span>, in fact, he was quite concerned about the <span class="text-highlight">way</span> music could either <span class="text-highlight">degrade</span> or <span class="text-highlight">elevate</span> the minds of <span class="text-highlight">young people</span> so you can see in some sense nothing has changed. He said <span class="text-highlight">rhythm</span> and <span class="text-highlight">harmony</span> find their way into the <span class="text-highlight">inward places</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">soul</span> well yes that's true and he said this in 400 BC, but what has changed since then. It's just in the last few years <span class="text-highlight">brain science</span> has started to seriously <span class="text-highlight">investigate</span> music, and this <span class="text-highlight">young science</span> is confirming music's <span class="text-highlight">power over</span> us. For example, some colleagues in Montreal <span class="text-highlight">decided to do</span> a <span class="text-highlight">study</span> to <span class="text-highlight">investigate</span> what <span class="text-highlight">happens in the brain</span> when people <span class="text-highlight">get chills to music</span> this is intense <span class="text-highlight">emotional responses</span> that often <span class="text-highlight">manifest themselves as shivers</span> tingling of the spines anybody here had this okay it's not <span class="text-highlight">uncommon</span> and they specifically looked at chills - <span class="text-highlight">instrumental music</span> so this wasn't due to any associations that people had with <span class="text-highlight">lyrics</span> it was just <span class="text-highlight">sounds of music</span> and they looked at they <span class="text-highlight">took advantage</span> of the fact that people often know quite well what <span class="text-highlight">music gives them chills</span> they know the piece sometimes the very passage in the piece and so they had people <span class="text-highlight">bring</span> in their own <span class="text-highlight">self-selected</span> <span class="text-highlight">CDs</span> and they <span class="text-highlight">scan</span> their brains while they were having these <span class="text-highlight">experiences</span> <span class="text-highlight">listening to music</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer delineated the power of music over human character and human emotions. He firstly concerned about the way music degraded or elevated the minds of young people. Additionally, he discussed rhythm and harmony find their ways into the inward places of the soul and brain science has started to seriously investigate music. He finally introduced studies in investigating what happens in the brain when people get chills to music. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "William Shakespeare (or Shakespeare's Poem)",
    transcript: `Let's think about perhaps the <span class="text-highlight">top 10 things</span> that people <span class="text-highlight">would like to know</span>, ought to know about <span class="text-highlight">Shakespeare</span>. But if they're getting into <span class="text-highlight">his works</span>.  First thing to say is that he <span class="text-highlight">did live quite a long time</span> ago he lived 400 years ago. So if you're <span class="text-highlight">reading Shakespeare</span> or <span class="text-highlight">listening</span> to Shakespeare, you're listening to <span class="text-highlight">somebody</span> whose <span class="text-highlight">language</span> is not quite the language of our <span class="text-highlight">current</span>, by current, you're listening to someone who <span class="text-highlight">was writing in a language</span>, which is a bit <span class="text-highlight">out of date</span> for now. It needs a little bit of <span class="text-highlight">effort</span> to <span class="text-highlight">understand</span> that language but <span class="text-highlight">the understanding will be done</span> partly for you by the actors if you're hearing it but if you're seeing it performed. Another thing is that Shakespeare was a very <span class="text-highlight">great poet</span> he wrote <span class="text-highlight">poems</span> are at <span class="text-highlight">narrative poems</span> and <span class="text-highlight">sonnets</span>, but he was also and this is my third point, he was also a great <span class="text-highlight">theatre poet</span> his poetry is <span class="text-highlight">dramatic poetry</span> in the plays. He's not just writing <span class="text-highlight">static poetry</span> lyric poetry in the plays which is therefore <span class="text-highlight">declamation</span>. He's writing <span class="text-highlight">dramatic poetry</span> which <span class="text-highlight">consists of</span> <span class="text-highlight">interaction</span> between the <span class="text-highlight">characters</span> <span class="text-highlight">of the plays</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about major things about Shakespeare, who lived a long time ago. Firstly, he explained that it requires efforts to understand Shakespeare’s language because it is out of date for now to read and listen. Additionally, Shakespeare was a great poet writing narrative poems and sonnets. Finally, he was also a great theatre poet, who wrote dramatic poetry that consists of interaction between the characters of the plays. _(70 words)_`,

    transcript: `Do you <span class="text-highlight">drink</span> <span class="text-highlight">enough water</span>? This is all <span class="text-highlight">water intake</span>. The, the <span class="text-highlight">old theory</span> was that we were <span class="text-highlight">supposed to</span> drink <span class="text-highlight">eight cups of water</span>. But that's, that's an <span class="text-highlight">old wives tale</span>. If we drink four <span class="text-highlight">cups</span> of water and take four cups of water in, we are eating <span class="text-highlight">lettuce</span> we eat <span class="text-highlight">pasta</span>, we eat <span class="text-highlight">soup</span>, we eat <span class="text-highlight">cup of coffee</span>, some latte, you know, we have all kinds, so we have all kinds of <span class="text-highlight">fluid</span> inside. So four cups of liquid, four cups of water in the <span class="text-highlight">food</span>. We generate about one and <span class="text-highlight">a half cups of water</span> just for <span class="text-highlight">metabolism</span>. You remember way back to the metabolism. Break down of carbohydrate yields <span class="text-highlight">carbon dioxide energy</span>, water, right down approach use carbon dioxide, energy, water nitrogen, breakdown every <span class="text-highlight">nutrient yields water</span>. That's <span class="text-highlight">what this water is</span>. So that's part of the <span class="text-highlight">water balance</span> .We are <span class="text-highlight">intake</span> is equivalent to <span class="text-highlight">approximately</span> <span class="text-highlight">ten cups</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer raised a question of whether people drink enough water. She firstly contested the old theory indicating that people were supposed to drink eight cups of water. Additionally, she stated that people should drink four cups of water and other four cups of water in food, namely lettuce, soup or coffee, to generate enough water for metabolism. She finally concluded that carbohydrates yield carbon dioxide, energy and water.`,

And I think this change may be as <span class="text-highlight">important</span> for businesses, as the change to <span class="text-highlight">democracy</span> has been for <span class="text-highlight">governments</span>. The reason I think that's happening is because it's now possible for the first time in <span class="text-highlight">human history,</span> to have the <span class="text-highlight">economic benefits</span> of very large <span class="text-highlight">organisations</span>, things like <span class="text-highlight">economies of scale</span> and <span class="text-highlight">knowledge</span>, and at the same time, to have the human benefits of small organisations, things like <span class="text-highlight">freedom</span>, <span class="text-highlight">flexibility</span>, <span class="text-highlight">creativity</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">motivation</span>. The reason I think that's possible, is because <span class="text-highlight">Information Technology</span> has now <span class="text-highlight">reduced</span> the <span class="text-highlight">cost of communication</span> to such a low level, that it's now possible for huge numbers of people, even in very large organisations, to have <span class="text-highlight">enough information</span> to <span class="text-highlight">make sensible decisions</span> for themselves.

    solution: `The lecturer talked about the early stages of a change toward human freedom in business. He firstly explained the economic benefits of both large and small organisations. Additionally, he introduced new concepts including economies of scale and knowledge, freedom, flexibility, creativity, and motivation.

    transcript: `For millennia for us, <span class="text-highlight">humans</span> <span class="text-highlight">forgetting's been</span> easy, spilled into us. Biologically, we <span class="text-highlight">forget</span> most of <span class="text-highlight">what we experience</span> every day our feelings, our thoughts. <span class="text-highlight">Remembering</span> is <span class="text-highlight">hard</span>. Since <span class="text-highlight">the beginning of time</span> we humans have tried to <span class="text-highlight">overcome</span> <span class="text-highlight">biological forgetting</span>, and to <span class="text-highlight">hold on to memories</span> that are <span class="text-highlight">precious</span>. For thousands of years, we have tried like this Navajo to <span class="text-highlight">pass on</span> our <span class="text-highlight">memories</span> to our children, and the hope that they to made us be able to remember this is how the <span class="text-highlight">great</span> <span class="text-highlight">epics of the world</span> emerged thousands of years ago.

    solution: `The lecturer talked about human memory, which is not fixed because it changes when people reconstruct the past. He firstly explained that human forgetting is easy while remembering is hard. Additionally, humans have tried to overcome biological forgetting of what we experience everyday, and to hold on to memories that are precious.

    transcript: `Last week, we talked about <span class="text-highlight">how people</span> <span class="text-highlight">recognise</span> <span class="text-highlight">objects</span>. And really <span class="text-highlight">how well people recognise objects</span>, given <span class="text-highlight">how difficult the problem</span> is, given how objects can be seen in all different sorts of <span class="text-highlight">illumination</span> in <span class="text-highlight">different positions</span> in <span class="text-highlight">different angles</span>. And yet, we're able to <span class="text-highlight">extract that information</span>, we're able to take the <span class="text-highlight">the visual stuff</span> out there, <span class="text-highlight">interpret</span> it in a way that allows us to <span class="text-highlight">recognise all the different things</span> that we can see in our environment.<br/><br/>
    Today, we're going to kind of <span class="text-highlight">carry on</span> looking at that, but we're going to look at what's really a special class of objects. That's the <span class="text-highlight">human face</span>. So we're going to look at <span class="text-highlight">how we recognise human faces</span> and how we do it quite as well as we do. We're really experts at <span class="text-highlight">recognising faces</span>. So again, we can think about how do we take that <span class="text-highlight">visual information</span>? And how do we <span class="text-highlight">transform</span> it into a form which allows us to <span class="text-highlight">put a name to a face</span>, and to do all the other <span class="text-highlight">clever things</span> that we can do with faces. So I'm going to start off again, by just sort of pointing out that it's a <span class="text-highlight">hard problem</span>, face recognition is a hard problem. And it's a <span class="text-highlight">clever thing</span> that we do. If you think about all the <span class="text-highlight">different types of faces</span> that you can recognise, and all the <span class="text-highlight">different types of information</span> that you can get from the face. You kind of start to <span class="text-highlight">appreciate</span> how well we can do face recognition. So you can look at a face and you can find out its <span class="text-highlight">identity</span>. So you can <span class="text-highlight">look at this sort of set</span> of all these different types of faces and you'll be able to recognise some of those people. You can tell things about their <span class="text-highlight">age</span>, about their <span class="text-highlight">gender</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about how well people recognise objects given how objects can be seen in different positions and angles. He firstly introduced how to extract information and interpret it in a way to recognise all the different things. Additionally, he explained how people can transform the visual information of human faces. Finally, while looking at a face, people can find out its identity, and tell things about their gender. _(70 words)_`,

Law is also a brilliant <span class="text-highlight">academic subject</span> to study in its own right. Even if you don't want to be lawyer it can provide a fantastic foundation for a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different future careers</span>. Why? Because it <span class="text-highlight">involves</span> not only <span class="text-highlight">studying and applying</span> the rules in an analytical way, but it goes a lot further than that. Law <span class="text-highlight">involves</span> a lot of <span class="text-highlight">different subjects</span>.

    transcript: `The <span class="text-highlight">discovery</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">structure of DNA</span> but something that was really <span class="text-highlight">important</span>, allowing <span class="text-highlight">scientists</span> to start looking at and thinking about the <span class="text-highlight">effect</span> of <span class="text-highlight">genes</span>, and how they might affect <span class="text-highlight">behaviour</span>. Okay? So early on, we might just think the <span class="text-highlight">genes were responsible</span> for our <span class="text-highlight">physical structure</span>, our <span class="text-highlight">height</span>, our <span class="text-highlight">hair colour</span>, and so on, and not so much for our behaviour. But we now know that there's probably at least some degree of <span class="text-highlight">genetic responsibility</span> for all of our <span class="text-highlight">actual behaviours</span> are <span class="text-highlight">psychological</span> behaviours as well, not just physical behaviours, and the mapping of the <span class="text-highlight">human genome</span> that was completed in 2001. What is that? I won't even dare ask if anyone heard about that. That gave us a lot of <span class="text-highlight">interesting information</span>. And it's been allowing both the study of biology but also the study of psychology and <span class="text-highlight">neuroscience</span> to <span class="text-highlight">progress rapidly</span> and <span class="text-highlight">start integrating information</span> about what we know from genes and studying it.`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed the structure of DNA, which is really important in knowing the effect of genes. She firstly explained how DNA may affect behaviour and why genes are responsible for our physical structure. Additionally, she claimed that there is probably genetic responsibility for actual and psychological behaviours, plus the mapping of human genome.

All languages of the world, <span class="text-highlight">natural languages</span> at least, have words for <span class="text-highlight">eye</span> and <span class="text-highlight">head</span> and <span class="text-highlight">nose</span> and <span class="text-highlight">ear</span> and for <span class="text-highlight">sky</span> and <span class="text-highlight">earth</span> and for <span class="text-highlight">water</span>, <span class="text-highlight">sand</span> and for <span class="text-highlight">sibling</span>, _-<span class="text-highlight">mother</span> and <span class="text-highlight">father</span>.  They may not have words for <span class="text-highlight">uncle</span> and <span class="text-highlight">aunt</span>.  It becomes much vaguer because in one culture an aunt is different when it comes from your father's side than from your mother's side.  You don't include <span class="text-highlight">snow</span>.  Most people know what snow is but in the <span class="text-highlight">tropics</span> you don't have it.  So you look for <span class="text-highlight">notions</span> that are totally <span class="text-highlight">comparable</span> and that occur everywhere <span class="text-highlight">in the world</span>.
You can the hundred or two hundred most <span class="text-highlight">universal notions</span> in a <span class="text-highlight">human life</span>, those which you call the basic vocabulary.  So you take basic vocabularies and languages that you think are <span class="text-highlight">related</span>.  You look for words that <span class="text-highlight">sound the same</span> and basically you're not fooled by a hundred per cent <span class="text-highlight">identical words</span> but you are really <span class="text-highlight">looking for words</span>, while they are <span class="text-highlight">different in one language from the other</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about basic vocabulary and languages that are related at several levels. She firstly indicated that natural languages of the world have specific words that are common and totally comparable. In addition, words become much vaguer in different cultures and people tend to look for words that sound the same.

    Which is to say we don't study <span class="text-highlight">outer space</span>. It can include the <span class="text-highlight">atmosphere</span>. We also don't study we don't typically anyway study like the <span class="text-highlight">center of</span> the<span class="text-highlight">earth</span>, but we also go <span class="text-highlight">underground</span>. And that is to say that we study <span class="text-highlight">virtually</span> anything. And we're proud of that fact.<br/><br/>
    And we have lots and lots of sub <span class="text-highlight">disciplines</span> within the field or fields within the discipline. And you can do almost anything in this field we call geography.

    topic: "Semantic Noise",
    transcript: `Semantic <span class="text-highlight">noise</span> in communication is a type of <span class="text-highlight">disturbance</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">transmission</span> of a message that interferes with the <span class="text-highlight">interpretation</span> of the <span class="text-highlight">messag</span>e due to ambiguity in words, sentences or symbols used in the transmission of the message. <br/><br/>
Let’s take a step back for a moment to provide a larger <span class="text-highlight">framework</span> that helps you understand the <span class="text-highlight">idea</span> of <span class="text-highlight">semantic noise</span> a bit easier. Communication is the <span class="text-highlight">process of transmitting information</span> from one person to another. Information is a <span class="text-highlight">pattern of data</span> organized in a particular way. For example, a <span class="text-highlight">sentence</span> consists of <span class="text-highlight">symbols</span> that form words in a particular language with a particular meaning. The sentence also utilizes <span class="text-highlight">grammar</span>, which is a <span class="text-highlight">recognized way</span> to structure words forming a sentence. Noise is any type of disturbance that <span class="text-highlight">interferes</span> with the interpretation of the information. Some argue that noise exists in all communication.
Semantic noise doesn’t involve sound but rather <span class="text-highlight">ambiguity</span> in words, <span class="text-highlight">sentences</span> or other <span class="text-highlight">symbols</span> used in communication. The ambiguity is caused because <span class="text-highlight">everybody sees</span> a different meaning in the same <span class="text-highlight">words</span>, <span class="text-highlight">phrases</span> or sentences. The differences in interpretation can be quite small, even <span class="text-highlight">undetectable</span>, in regular communication between people from the same <span class="text-highlight">culture</span>, <span class="text-highlight">age</span>, <span class="text-highlight">education</span> and experience, or <span class="text-highlight">drastically different</span> because of such things as culture, age or experience.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about semantic noise in communication, which is a type of disturbance in the transmission of a message. He firstly introduced that semantic noise interferes with the interpretation of the message due to ambiguity in words, sentences and symbols. Additionally, the ambiguity is caused because everybody sees a different meaning in the same phrases. Finally, the differences can be undetectable or drastic because of culture, age or experience. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Brain Development",
    transcript: `About 20 years ago Kent Anger and Barry Johnson came up with 750 <span class="text-highlight">chemicals</span> that could <span class="text-highlight">harm</span> the <span class="text-highlight">brain</span> during <span class="text-highlight">development</span>. Nobody has since then dared to update that number, it's just a guess today, there has to be more than a thousand if there was 750 twenty years ago. But the <span class="text-highlight">problem</span> is also that we have put too little <span class="text-highlight">emphasis</span> on this type of, uh, research. For example, it has taken so far the OECD 10 years to <span class="text-highlight">devise</span> a <span class="text-highlight">battery</span> of tests that they could recommend for <span class="text-highlight">systematic testing</span> of chemicals for <span class="text-highlight">developmental neurotoxicity</span>. That panel, that battery, has not yet been <span class="text-highlight">completed</span> and <span class="text-highlight">authorised</span> by OECD so it's taking way, way, way too long because it is <span class="text-highlight">complicated</span>. But there is so much at stake. Children are just losing IQ points and losing their <span class="text-highlight">concentration</span> <span class="text-highlight">span</span>, <span class="text-highlight">memory</span> or motor functions. But in the present world where there's so much emphasis on <span class="text-highlight">knowledge</span> and <span class="text-highlight">brain functions</span> this can also <span class="text-highlight">translate into</span> dollars. The EPA has <span class="text-highlight">calculated</span> that every time a child loses one IQ point because of <span class="text-highlight">chemical pollution</span> it <span class="text-highlight">costs</span> society something like $8,000 or $10,000.`,
    solution: `The lecturer mentioned two scientists who came up with many chemicals that could harm the brain during development. He firstly highlighted the problem of putting little emphasis on this type of research. Additionally, it has taken the organization many years to devise a battery of tests because it is complicated. Finally, every time a child loses IQ points because of chemical pollution, it costs society a huge amount of money. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "The Mars",
    transcript: `It's basically the most <span class="text-highlight">interesting place</span>, <span class="text-highlight">smaller planet</span> than Earth, but it has as much <span class="text-highlight">land</span> as Earth does, because it doesn't have any <span class="text-highlight">oceans</span> and there's plenty of it to explore. And it's a place with the <span class="text-highlight">highest mountain</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">solar system</span>. Olympus, which is so <span class="text-highlight">tall</span>, it sticks out into space, which incidentally makes it a brilliant place to put an <span class="text-highlight">observatory</span>. And but it also has the <span class="text-highlight">biggest Canyon system</span> in the solar system, and the balance mariners. And it has <span class="text-highlight">seasons</span> it has to grow, and then melt as the year goes on. And it has occasionally has <span class="text-highlight">clouds</span> and in many ways it's a <span class="text-highlight">planet</span>, much like around the rest of the <span class="text-highlight">solar system</span> is either weird <span class="text-highlight">lava</span> gas giants, and all things like <span class="text-highlight">Mercury</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Venus</span> which are <span class="text-highlight">too hot</span> to be <span class="text-highlight">comfortable</span> sun <span class="text-highlight">Mars</span> is the <span class="text-highlight">ideal destination</span>. If we go to go beyond the room planet, <span class="text-highlight">scientifically</span>, it's particularly I think the question that we're interested in more than anything else in <span class="text-highlight">astronomy</span>, is whether we as living beings are <span class="text-highlight">unique</span> in the <span class="text-highlight">solar system</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about Mars, which is basically the most interesting place and smaller than Earth. He firstly introduced that Mars is a place with the highest mountain, which incidentally makes it a brilliant place to put an observatory. Additionally, Mars is the ideal destination because it has seasons, polar caps and clouds. Finally, whether we, as living beings, are unique in the solar system is still an interesting question. _(70 words)_`,

Right. So we're talking about the <span class="text-highlight">origin of symbolic systems</span>. <span class="text-highlight">Language</span> is a <span class="text-highlight">classic</span> symbolic system. Apparently one <span class="text-highlight">theory</span> for why <span class="text-highlight">language evolved</span> is that <span class="text-highlight">people communicated</span> with <span class="text-highlight">sign language</span> and with movement quite well for a long time.

My friend found him in the <span class="text-highlight">interview</span>, couldn't make <span class="text-highlight">interesting observations</span> about his company just didn't seem sharp.

The ones who are <span class="text-highlight">most equal</span> are the ones called <span class="text-highlight">G7</span>, the seven <span class="text-highlight">rich industrial countries</span>.

More and more <span class="text-highlight">young people</span> around the world are <span class="text-highlight">rejecting</span> the <span class="text-highlight">culture</span> they <span class="text-highlight">grew up in</span>. And it's probably a little bit cruel, but some are <span class="text-highlight">imitating</span> the Hollywood model of society rather than than one, which they <span class="text-highlight">inherit</span> from their <span class="text-highlight">local</span> <span class="text-highlight">tradition background</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about globalization, which is an idea that people can have instant communications and live in a global village. Firstly, he explained that the world is accelerating and shrinking in terms of speed and distance. Additionally, he mentioned detraditionalization which is the erosion of traditional cultures, conventional ways of doing things, and conventional moralities. Finally, young people around the world are rejecting the culture they grew up in. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Chimpanzees",
    transcript: `So now we needed to find our <span class="text-highlight">chimpanzee</span>. Our chimpanzee, first we found two of them in the state of New York. Both of them would <span class="text-highlight">die</span> before we could even get our suits filed. Then we found Tommy. Tommy is a chimpanzee. You see him behind me. Tommy was a chimpanzee. We found him in that <span class="text-highlight">cage</span>. We found him in a small room that was filled with cages in a larger warehouse structure on a used trailer lot in central New York. We found Kiko, who is partially deaf. Kiko was in the back of a cement storefront in western Massachusetts. And we found Hercules and Leo. They're two young male chimpanzees who are being used for <span class="text-highlight">biomedical</span>, <span class="text-highlight">anatomical</span> <span class="text-highlight">research</span> at Stony Brook. We found them. <br/><br/>
    And so on the last week of December 2013, the Nonhuman Rights Project filed <span class="text-highlight">three suits</span> all across the <span class="text-highlight">state</span> of <span class="text-highlight">New York</span> using the same <span class="text-highlight">common law</span> writ of habeus corpus argument that had been used with James Somerset, and we <span class="text-highlight">demanded</span> that the <span class="text-highlight">judges issue these common law</span> writs of habeus corpus. We <span class="text-highlight">wanted the chimpanzees out</span>, and we wanted them brought to Save the Chimps, a <span class="text-highlight">tremendous</span> chimpanzee <span class="text-highlight">sanctuary</span> in <span class="text-highlight">South Florida</span> which involves an <span class="text-highlight">artificial lake</span> with 12 or 13 islands -- there are two or three acres where two dozen chimpanzees live on each of them. And these chimpanzees would then <span class="text-highlight">live the life</span> of a chimpanzee, with other chimpanzees in an <span class="text-highlight">environment</span> that was as <span class="text-highlight">close</span> to <span class="text-highlight">Africa</span> as <span class="text-highlight">possible</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about chimpanzees that were found in a cage in New York. He firstly indicated that two of them were used for biomedical and anatomical research. Additionally, he demanded the judges should issue laws to protect these chimpanzees and bring them back to a tremendous chimpanzee sanctuary. Finally, he argued that they should have lived their lives in an environment that was as close to Africa as possible.`,

    topic: "Smart City",
    transcript: `I will start the point for this <span class="text-highlight">new project</span> on , was reflecting on the <span class="text-highlight">smart city</span> trend that took hold of the last decade. While <span class="text-highlight">smart technologies</span>such as <span class="text-highlight">automated traffic lights</span>, been around some point early 1900s, the concept of an <span class="text-highlight">urban strategy</span> really seemed to <span class="text-highlight">take off</span> with more recent <span class="text-highlight">developments</span> technology. A <span class="text-highlight">smart city</span>, as most people understand it now is a city that <span class="text-highlight">integrates</span> <span class="text-highlight">information and communication</span> <span class="text-highlight">technology</span> and <span class="text-highlight">the Internet of Things</span> to <span class="text-highlight">manage</span> the <span class="text-highlight">city's assets</span>. So for example, in Barcelona, they <span class="text-highlight">implemented</span> a <span class="text-highlight">sensor system</span> for <span class="text-highlight">drivers</span> that got to <span class="text-highlight">available</span> <span class="text-highlight">parking</span> <span class="text-highlight">spaces</span>. Be sensors which are <span class="text-highlight">embedded</span> into the ground <span class="text-highlight">can sense</span> whether or not a <span class="text-highlight">vehicle</span> is parked to begin to location and by <span class="text-highlight">directing drivers</span> to <span class="text-highlight">open spaces</span> means that there's no but <span class="text-highlight">allegedly</span> <span class="text-highlight">reduce</span> <span class="text-highlight">congestion</span> and <span class="text-highlight">emissions</span>. Another <span class="text-highlight">example</span> would be the use of<span class="text-highlight">intelligent street lights</span> in Glasgow, so they also use sensors but to <span class="text-highlight">turn lights</span> <span class="text-highlight">on and off</span> at night, depending on the <span class="text-highlight">phone</span> in order to <span class="text-highlight">save</span> <span class="text-highlight">energy</span>. But there's a question here about whether or not there's one in terms of using the <span class="text-highlight">source of technology</span> at levels of data that is being collected with it.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about a smart city that integrates information and communication technology. She firstly mentioned automated traffic lights, the concept of an urban strategy, and the Internet of Things to manage the city's assets. Additionally, she introduced a sensor system for drivers to look for parking spaces and reduce congestion and emissions. Finally, she concluded by an example of the use of intelligent streetlights depending smartphones to save energy.`,

    topic: "Fish Dwell",
    transcript: `To us, the <span class="text-highlight">environment</span> in which fish dwell often seems <span class="text-highlight">cold</span>, <span class="text-highlight">dark</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">mysterious</span>. But there are <span class="text-highlight">advantages</span>to living in water, and they have <span class="text-highlight">played an important role</span> in making fish what they are. One is that water isn't subject to <span class="text-highlight">sudden</span>  <span class="text-highlight">temperature changes</span>. Therefore, it makes an excellent <span class="text-highlight">habitat</span> for a cold-blooded <span class="text-highlight">animal</span>. Mother advantage is the <span class="text-highlight">water's ability</span> to easily <span class="text-highlight">support body weight</span>. Protoplasm has approximately the same <span class="text-highlight">density</span> as water, so a fish in water is almost <span class="text-highlight">weightless</span>. This "weightlessness" in turn means two things: One, a fish can <span class="text-highlight">get along with</span> a <span class="text-highlight">light weight</span> and <span class="text-highlight">simple bone structure</span>, and two, <span class="text-highlight">limitations</span> to a fish's <span class="text-highlight">size</span> are <span class="text-highlight">practically</span> <span class="text-highlight">removed</span>. Yet there is one basic difficulty to living In water—the fact that It's <span class="text-highlight">incompressible</span>. For a fish to move through water, it must actually <span class="text-highlight">shove</span> it aside. Most can do this by wiggling back and forth in snakelike motion. The <span class="text-highlight">fish</span> pushes water aside by the forward motion of its head, and with the <span class="text-highlight">curve of its body</span> and its <span class="text-highlight">flexible tail.</span> Next, the water flows back along the fish's narrowing sides, closing in at the tall, and helping the fish <span class="text-highlight">propel</span> itself forward. The fact that water is incompressible has <span class="text-highlight">literally shaped</span> the <span class="text-highlight">development of fish</span>. A <span class="text-highlight">flat</span> and <span class="text-highlight">angular</span> shape can be <span class="text-highlight">moved through water</span> only with <span class="text-highlight">difficulty</span>. And for this reason, fish have a <span class="text-highlight">basic shape</span> that is <span class="text-highlight">beautifully</span> <span class="text-highlight">adapted</span> to deal with this <span class="text-highlight">peculiarity</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about how water has literally shaped the development of fish. He firstly explained water is not subject to sudden temperature changes, and this makes an excellent habitat for the animal. Additionally, the water’s ability supports a fish’s body weight and limitations to its size are practically removed because water is incompressible. Finally, fish have a basic shape that is beautifully adapted to deal with this peculiarity. _(70 words)_`,

Now, even though there's a lot of <span class="text-highlight">skepticism,</span> originally about using this <span class="text-highlight">survey</span> - surveys what people say <span class="text-highlight">make them happy</span>. The number of reason that we are getting increasingly confident in doing so. One is that their <span class="text-highlight">consistent pattem</span> - <span class="text-highlight">remarkable consistent pattern</span>, that determines <span class="text-highlight">well-being</span> across large samples of people, across countries, across the world, and over time.

Some of these very basic things are <span class="text-highlight">remarkable</span> consistent <span class="text-highlight">across countries across world</span>. So that <span class="text-highlight">gives us some sense</span> that these surveys are picking up <span class="text-highlight">consistent patterns</span>. And when we know what consistent patterns are, we can look how other things that very much more, <span class="text-highlight">affect people's well-being</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">environment</span> and<span class="text-highlight">equality</span>, the <span class="text-highlight">natures institution</span> <span class="text-highlight">raging on living</span>, and all kinds of <span class="text-highlight">other things that very much more</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about a survey of happiness economics that estimates what people say make them happy. She firstly explained that the remarkably consistent pattern of the survey determines well-being across large samples of people in different countries. Additionally, basic factors that make people happy are income health, marital status and employment status. Finally, she concluded that other elements including environment and equality factors also significantly affect people's well-being. _(70 words)_`,

Ms. Lambert specializes In <span class="text-highlight">research</span> on the workplace and recently has been writing about the <span class="text-highlight">future of work</span>. This topic should be of special interest, since I know many of you are already at the <span class="text-highlight">forefront</span> of <span class="text-highlight">workplace technology</span>. For example, let's have a show of hands to see how many people here<span class="text-highlight">telecommute</span> at least part of the time. Hmm. I see eight hands raised. Well, you eight folks who <span class="text-highlight">work at home</span> and <span class="text-highlight">communicate</span> with your office via <span class="text-highlight">computer</span> represent one of the trends Ms. Lambert has described: that people are becoming less <span class="text-highlight">tied to the workplace</span> One of the <span class="text-highlight">important tools</span> for <span class="text-highlight">telecommuting</span> is <span class="text-highlight">electronic mail</span>, or E-mail. E-mail lets you send and <span class="text-highlight">receive messages</span> almost immediately on your <span class="text-highlight">computer</span>, but you control when you made them and when you <span class="text-highlight">respond</span> to them. This technology <span class="text-highlight">allows people</span> to have <span class="text-highlight">more control</span> over time than when <span class="text-highlight">relying solely on</span> the telephone. Our guest tonight will <span class="text-highlight">discuss</span> how these <span class="text-highlight">important changes</span> will <span class="text-highlight">alter the way</span> we <span class="text-highlight">work</span>. But, before <span class="text-highlight">turning the floor</span> over to Ms. Lambert, I would just like to <span class="text-highlight">remind</span> you that she will be <span class="text-highlight">available</span> to <span class="text-highlight">answer</span> any <span class="text-highlight">individual questions</span> at the reception immediately following this talk.`,
    solution: `The lecturer discussed workplace technology that can be used for people working at home and communicating with their office via computers. He firstly explained that this trend represents that people are becoming less tied to the workplace. Additionally, E-mail lets people send and receive messages immediately on their computers, but they control when to read and respond to them.

    topic: "Technological nature",
    transcript: `<span class="text-highlight">Technological nature</span>, you may have heard this term. It's a term used to describe a picture of a <span class="text-highlight">natural scene</span> that"s been produced using <span class="text-highlight">computer graphics</span> so that basically it isn't a real view - say of a <span class="text-highlight">garden or field</span> - it's a virtual one - it's a picture that looks like a real scene, Now, looking at scenes of <span class="text-highlight">nature</span> is known to have an effect on <span class="text-highlight">people's health</span> and well-being. So for someone who's ill, for a patient in a <span class="text-highlight">hospital</span>, does a <span class="text-highlight">virtual view</span>of a garden have the same impact as a real one? Does it have the same <span class="text-highlight">beneficial effects</span> when you look at it? Because that would be good. Well, urn, if you test this out, if you put a group of people in a room with a real view and another group of people in a room with a virtual view - an <span class="text-highlight">unreal</span> view - you can see what happens when they get stressed. If you give both <span class="text-highlight">groups</span> a <span class="text-highlight">task</span> that is slightly <span class="text-highlight">stressful</span> and increases their <span class="text-highlight">heart rate</span> and, um, what you'll find is that the people who have the real <span class="text-highlight">garden</span> <span class="text-highlight">scene</span> outside their <span class="text-highlight">window</span> to look at - their <span class="text-highlight">heart rate</span> goes back to <span class="text-highlight">normal</span> more <span class="text-highlight">quickly</span> than those of the people in the other group who only have a virtual view to look at. So, yes, there is a <span class="text-highlight">difference</span> - people's <span class="text-highlight">recovery</span> from <span class="text-highlight">stress</span> is <span class="text-highlight">faster</span> in the room with the real view.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about technological nature, which is produced by using computer graphics. He firstly mentioned looking at scenes of nature has effects on people’s health. Additionally, he found that heart rate of patients who were in a room with a real scene goes back to normal quickly than those who only have a virtual view. Finally, people’s recovery from stress is faster in the room with the real scene. _(70 words)_`,

    topic: "Citizenship Curriculum",
    transcript: `Last month I <span class="text-highlight">published alongside</span> my <span class="text-highlight">annual report</span>, a subject report on the <span class="text-highlight">development of citizenship</span> in schools. The <span class="text-highlight">report celebrates</span> the <span class="text-highlight">success of some schools</span> in <span class="text-highlight">implementing</span> the <span class="text-highlight">citizenship curriculum</span>. It praises those schools, where they have taken and have <span class="text-highlight">substantial development</span> in the subject, and which now go a long way towards fulfilling <span class="text-highlight">national</span>  <span class="text-highlight">curriculum requirements</span>. In the reports, we are<span class="text-highlight">critical of schools</span> which have not <span class="text-highlight">taken</span> citizenship <span class="text-highlight">seriously</span>, either through <span class="text-highlight">reluctance</span> or <span class="text-highlight">lack of capacity</span> to make <span class="text-highlight">appropriate provisions</span> in a curriculum. Citizenship is marginalised in the curriculum, and in one fifth of schools. It is <span class="text-highlight">less well established</span>in the curriculum that other subjects and <span class="text-highlight">less well taught</span>. Some <span class="text-highlight">critics</span> have seized on this as a <span class="text-highlight">reason</span> for wanting to step back from supporting it. Yes. The <span class="text-highlight">progress</span> made to date by the more <span class="text-highlight">committed school</span> suggests that the reasons for <span class="text-highlight">introducing citizenship</span> are both <span class="text-highlight">worthwhile</span> and can be fulfilled given the <span class="text-highlight">time</span> and <span class="text-highlight">resources</span>. Indeed, <span class="text-highlight">those reasons</span> are given <span class="text-highlight">added weight</span> by <span class="text-highlight">national</span> and <span class="text-highlight">global events</span> of the past few months. While not <span class="text-highlight">claiming too much citizenship</span> can <span class="text-highlight">address core skills</span>, <span class="text-highlight">attitudes</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">values</span> that <span class="text-highlight">young people</span> need to consider as they come to terms with a changing <span class="text-highlight">world</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about his annual report that celebrates the success of some schools in implementing the citizenship curriculum. Firstly, he opposed schools which have not taken citizenship seriously through reluctance or lack of capacity. Additionally, the subject is less well established in the curriculum than other subjects and less well taught. Finally, he concluded that citizenship can address core skills, attitudes and values that young people need to consider. (70 words)_`,

    topic: "National Oceanography Center",
    transcript: `The National Oceanography Center (NOC) is engaged in <span class="text-highlight">research</span> into the <span class="text-highlight">potential risks</span> and benefits of exploiting deep-sea <span class="text-highlight">mineral resources</span>, some of which are essential for <span class="text-highlight">low-carbon technology</span>, as well as using ocean <span class="text-highlight">robots</span> to estimate the <span class="text-highlight">environmental impact</span> of these potential deep-sea <span class="text-highlight">mining activities</span>. Late last year the NOC led an <span class="text-highlight">expedition</span> on the RRS James Cook that found enough of the <span class="text-highlight">scarce element</span> Tellurium present in the crust of a submerged <span class="text-highlight">volcano</span> that, if it were all to be used in the production of solar PV <span class="text-highlight">panels</span>, could provide two-thirds of the UK's annual <span class="text-highlight">electricity supply</span>. Recently, the NOC also led an <span class="text-highlight">international study</span> demonstrating deep-sea nodule mining will cause long-lasting damage to deep-sea life, lasting at least for decades. These <span class="text-highlight">nodules</span>are potato-sized rocks <span class="text-highlight">containing high levels of metals</span>, including copper, manganese, and nickel. They grow very slowly on the <span class="text-highlight">sea-bed</span>, over millions of years. Although no <span class="text-highlight">commercial operations</span> exist to <span class="text-highlight">extract these resources</span>, many are planned. Professor Edward Hill, Executive Director at the NOC commented, "By 2050 there will be <span class="text-highlight">nine billion people</span> on earth and <span class="text-highlight">attention is increasingly</span> turning to the ocean, particularly the <span class="text-highlight">deep ocean</span>, for food, <span class="text-highlight">clean supplies</span> of <span class="text-highlight">energy</span> and <span class="text-highlight">strategic minerals</span>. The NOC is undertaking research related to many <span class="text-highlight">aspects</span> and <span class="text-highlight">perspectives</span> Involved in exploiting <span class="text-highlight">ocean resources</span>. This research is aimed at informing with <span class="text-highlight">sound scientific evidence</span> the decisions that will need to be taken. In the future, as people increasingly turn to the oceans to address some of <span class="text-highlight">society's greatest challenges</span>.`,

    topic: "Voice",
    transcript: `Today we're going to <span class="text-highlight">practice evaluating the main tool</span> used when addressing groups—the voice. There are <span class="text-highlight">three main elements</span> that combine to create either a <span class="text-highlight">positive or negative experience for listeners</span>. They can result in a voice that is <span class="text-highlight">pleasing to listen</span> to and <span class="text-highlight">can be used effectively</span>. Or they can <span class="text-highlight">create a voice</span> that doesn't <span class="text-highlight">hold attention</span>, or even worse, causes an <span class="text-highlight">adverse reaction</span>. The three elements are <span class="text-highlight">volume</span>, <span class="text-highlight">pitch</span>, and <span class="text-highlight">pace</span>. When evaluating volume, keep in mind that a <span class="text-highlight">good speaker</span> will adjust to the <span class="text-highlight">size of both the room and the audience.</span> Of course, with an <span class="text-highlight">amplifying device</span> like a microphone, the speaker can use a <span class="text-highlight">natural tone</span>. But speakers should not be dependent on <span class="text-highlight">microphones</span>; a good speaker can speak loudly without shouting. The <span class="text-highlight">second element</span>, pitch, is related to the <span class="text-highlight">highness</span> or <span class="text-highlight">lowness</span> of the sounds. <span class="text-highlight">High pitches</span> are, for most people, more difficult to listen to, so <span class="text-highlight">in general</span> speakers should use the <span class="text-highlight">lower registers</span> of their voice. During a presentation, <span class="text-highlight">it's important</span> to vary <span class="text-highlight">pitch</span> to some extent in order to <span class="text-highlight">maintain interest</span>. The <span class="text-highlight">third element</span>, pace, that is how fast or slow <span class="text-highlight">words and sounds are articulated</span>, should also be varied. A <span class="text-highlight">slower pace</span> can be used to <span class="text-highlight">emphasize important points</span>. Note that <span class="text-highlight">the time spent</span> not speaking can be meaningful, too. Pauses ought to be used to <span class="text-highlight">signal transitions</span> or create <span class="text-highlight">anticipation</span>. Because a pause <span class="text-highlight">gives the listeners time</span> to think about what was just said, or even to predict what might come next, it can be very <span class="text-highlight">effective</span> when moving from one topic to another. What I'd like you to do now is <span class="text-highlight">watch and listen</span> to a <span class="text-highlight">videotape</span> and <span class="text-highlight">use the forms</span> I gave you to <span class="text-highlight">rate the speaking voices</span> you hear. Then tonight I want you to go home and read a <span class="text-highlight">passage</span> into a tape recorder and <span class="text-highlight">evaluate</span> your <span class="text-highlight">own voice</span>.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about the voice that can hold attention and cause adverse reactions. She firstly mentioned three main elements including volume, pitch, and pace can combine to create positive or negative experiences for listeners. Additionally, speakers should not be dependent on microphones and a slower pace can be used to emphasize important points. Finally, she recommended students to go home and read a passage to evaluate their own voice.`,

    topic: "Body Fat Experiment",
    transcript: `There was another study, published much earlier. This goes back 15 years, done by some <span class="text-highlight">Canadian researchers</span>. This is <span class="text-highlight">interesting and even probably a better designed study</span>. They got 31 <span class="text-highlight">obese women</span>. They were youngish to middle aged women... volunteer for an exercise programme. Six months, all of them <span class="text-highlight">agreed not to change their diet</span>. They did <span class="text-highlight">diet records</span> on a <span class="text-highlight">regular basis</span> to try to ensure that they weren’t changing their diet. They <span class="text-highlight">exercised daily</span>, <span class="text-highlight">burned probably about 2000 calories</span> a week during... through exercise. Six months later, they ended the, <span class="text-highlight">the experiment</span>, <span class="text-highlight">had a body fat test</span>. So this is <span class="text-highlight">real body fat changes</span>. This is where they actually <span class="text-highlight">measure body fat</span> <span class="text-highlight">with a hydrostatic weight</span>. Very <span class="text-highlight">accurate measure</span> to look at body fat. And you can see, similar to the previous slide, you had <span class="text-highlight">some women that lost a significant amount of body fat</span>. You had a few women in here that didn't do much of anything. And then you <span class="text-highlight">had some gainers</span> over here. All of them were equally adhering you might say, well, maybe these women just didn't show up. And they did. They <span class="text-highlight">tracked their records</span>, <span class="text-highlight">supervised exercise</span>, everyone showed up, <span class="text-highlight">same amount of time</span>. And yet <span class="text-highlight">you have some that gained and some that lost</span>. And this is <span class="text-highlight">actual body fat changes</span>. And you might ask the question: How do you explain this? Well, there's only <span class="text-highlight">two ways to explain</span> it. Either, they ate a lot more and were kind of <span class="text-highlight">cheating on their diet records</span>. Or they just <span class="text-highlight">subconsciously or consciously</span> did less throughout the day.`,
    solution: `The lecturer talked about a study done by Canadian researchers. He firstly introduced that 31 women volunteered for an exercise programme without changing their diet. Additionally, they did diet records regularly and exercised daily. Six months later, they had a body fat test: some lost a significant amount, a few did not change, and there were some gainers. Finally, there are two ways to explain: they cheated or did less.`,
